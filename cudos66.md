[00:01:37] Citizen Comos: Hey everyone, welcome to a new episode of Citizen Cosmos. Today we have Matt, the CEO of Cudos with us. Hi and welcome to the show!

[00:01:47] Matt: It's great to be here, thanks for having me on!

[00:01:49] Citizen Cosmos: Really glad for having you on, it was an interesting story of how we got this actually to happen. Behind the scenes the story was that we were doing some background questions to people of our Telegram channel. To people who were just gathering feedback and then one of the guys was like “I’m in this channel because I want to talk about recording an interview. We asked which project, and he said Cudos, so we agreed. Matt, first question. I usually ask this everyone. Please, introduce yourself in your own words and tell us what you do and anything else you would like to add to that of course.

[00:02:31] Matt: Sure. I guess my background is previously running one of the largest datacenter companies in the UK, we ran that for about sixteen years, built one of the largest networks as well, kind of built an early version of decentralized cloud in about fifty five locations around the world and really we just saw the growth in demand for computing but also all the waste and in 2016 we could now build a platform, use modern technologies to make use of that spare capacity. So if you look at that infrastructure market, it rose about twenty billion a year so it's a huge market but you've got over a billion devices that are unused around the world and if you look, 30% of the spare computing or 30% of the available capacity in all those devices can then be used for other purposes on average. 60% of the CO2 that gets produced in building a server and is now actually just used up it at the start of its lifetime rather than its operations and more more countries and locations moved to renewable energy, that number gets bigger and bigger. We reduced that CO2 impact using equipment that already exists but also making better utilization of capacity that's already out there so really that's where I came from and we wanted
to build a blockchain that is able to power both traditional cloud computing which is kind of our background in the infrastructure market as well as the growing demand needs for computing blockchain today. So in blockchain you have small amounts of compute but then you also have much larger demands and there isn't really a solution that we believe that is able to service that. So metaverse needs thousands of tens of thousands of nodes if they're going to scale users. So we wanted to build and design a blockchain that was designed to scale compute to the levels that tradition cloud is able to support and make it more sustainable. We're very passionate and being carbon neutral ourselves as a business. Now we work with a lot of ESD projects in that spot. That's pretty much our background as well as in coming from making things more sustainable and greener. We are the infrastructure blockchain that is able to power additional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure as well as the infrastructure need for Web3. 

[00:04:45] Citizen Cosmos: This is a good good explanation and I do have some questions for you of course about that.  quite a lot actually but before we get to that, just some more background a little bit. Cudo and Cudos. Are they related? Because there was a confusion. When you go on your website, there is Cudo and there is Cudos. Are those just the name of the company and the blockchain or is there anything else to understand here?

[00:05:09] Matt: That's essentially it. That is the primary difference. Cudo is what we started out right back in 2017. Cudo is actual a coin in Latin. We wanted to build a network that was able for anyone to be able to earn from it. So that's where it came from and then Cudos was the name for our blockchain and that's because we want to do good with that network. The other phrase for Cudos “Giving Cudos, you're giving good.” We work a lot in sustainable projects and good causes in that space but really from a technical separation that's essentially how they work.

[00:05:47] Citizen Cosmos: This happens sometimes in blockchain and then crypto where the company name is very similar to the blockchain and people get confused. I didn't know Cudo was Latin for coin. By the way, about sustainability. I don't mean it as a general question but as a personal question to you. What's the whole deal with the working with green things and sustainability and trying to lower carbon emissions. Why is it important to you personally? 

[00:06:1] Matt: That kind of came from running datacenter business and I was seeing what huge impact that industry has on CO2 and the amount of energy that used in the world and we had thousands of racks in datacenters around world. so we were impact in that as well. So when we build our own datacenter we made sure that was all manual energy as efficient and green as we could but we have seen all these other datacenters still running inefficiently or still not being able to feel the capacity. So that's kind of where it comes from. From being involved in that inefficiency to start with and we had the power to improve our own environment but not to improve the other environments that we were working with. By building a platform ourselves we can improve the environments around the world in many locations in whoever contributes on to  the network. Probably within my technical capability it was the biggest impact that I think we could have.

[00:07:07] Citizen Cosmos: I have slightly devil's advocate question here about sustainability. There is a lot about it mentioned on the website. I think there is even documentation. I'm not sure why did this question come to my mind but to me like wherever we have computing power especially at centralized financial entities or centralized big companies that require some IT security, they will never be ready to share spare computing power whatever happens. As long as I can see that. Maybe I'm wrong, feel free to correct me. So, how do we go about this? The reason I'm asking this is because of the mission of the projects like Cudos is to stop people wasting computing power and make the world better. It is a great mission but I think that there is always going to be all these companies that will never want to be share it. What do you say about this?

[00:08:07] Matt: I definitely agree. If you think of our blockchain platforms, we connect supply and demand across different types of infrastructure. And from a supply perspective then we looked at the market first before building anything and looked at where we're going to get the largest amount of compute and the largest traction and investigate enterprises and they have security policies ae very hard to get around, they don't want to run software that they don't necessarily full control of inside their environment. So it's not actually a suitable environment for them to share. Home users that don't have those security policies. As long as the application itself is secure it is mining farms which we work with and we make better use of their computing capacity because they used to run into party applications. So the home uses give you high end graphic cards and processes not the best network and not all of the time mining farms give you very high end graphic cards which is one of the most expensive resources in compute today. Our ultimate goal there is to replace proof of work with real work but it's kind of a stage to approach that we do there and then the last area is around service providers and data centers and that environment gives you the IT regulations that you need. They've already got those environments that meet the security regulations, they already have everything in place to be able to split up that technology to make as secure as cloud is today. So it's really down to then on the demand side what type of environment do you want to run your computing. If you've got private data you're only going to want to run it inside you the data center environment and service providers. If you've got public data, any large sets that don't have any particular value in them, they're perfect for running out to the engine machines. And then you’re in your middle ground which is things like video rendering of television adverts or social media efforts. Things like this have the IP concern. That's actually idea we're running inside mining farms with the high graphic cards so it's all down to the data that you're happy to run where you choose and that's how we've designed it. We've built different software that runs in each of these environments. So we've got a desktop application that runs on Windows and Linux. We built mining management software that actually integrates to be mining farm software for that environment and then we built a specific datacenter environment version so that we could run in that as well.

[00:10:57] Citizen Cosmos: I'm curious as to the type of the reaction that businesses or private private uses as you mentioned referred to them have when you come up to them and say we want to give you a piece of software use part of your computing power and you get a reward. What is the reaction? What's the initial reaction that you get?

[00:11:24] Matt: The desktop version of our software had about six hundred thousand users sign up to it so far so it's installed in over  a hundred and forty countries so they're quite comfortable with that application. We've got various mining farms running our other mining fund version of the software and they see it as a brand new revenue screen and they're already used to run in those applications. Then datacenters, that is our background, we have everything to match the way that they work generally as a business anyway. For them they see it as kind of a new oline revenue that improving their efficiency. So we've been building this for nearly five years now so there's a lot of progress on that side.

[00:12:05] Citizen Cosmos: That is really cool! My next question is about the five years but I'm going to start a bit earlier. You mentioned datacenter and you said in your introduction that you were in charge of one of the biggest if not the biggest datacenter in the UK. What's the story> How did you end up from working for one of the biggest datacenters to starting a blockchain startup? How did you bring crypto into that and how did you go from one thing to another, and how has it been going for five years? 

[00:12:42] Matt: I founded that company back in 2000 and that was just as the internet was taking off. I actually had a website which became one of the busiest in the UK back then and we needed lots of traffic and lots of service so we started renting. The costs were going up and I knew I needed to set this environment up myself so we bought some data in a space and bandwidth, got it all set up but we had to get multiple supplies, it took time all different contracts and realized actually everyone else as the internet was taking off must be having exactly the same problem and challenge getting into cloud essentially because this before Amazon and
Google cloud and the other providers that we've got today. So we kind of packaged that service up and made it easier for people to build and get on to the early version the cloud to the internet and obviously that's the right time and it's exact parallels of what we're seeing now in blockchain. Our approach to do exactly the same is to make it much easier for people to get on board and a scale. So that model worked, we ended up growing into fifty five data centers around the world, we built our own fiber network, built cloud platforms across multiple datacenters, we only built one day so we took kind suits and lots of other data and it just was the right time to launch that type of service. It's an industry that has taken off where you make that journey easier and that's essentially how Amazon and Google have succeeded and all these uses all of a sudden realized that it  is now an easy version to deploy unto the internet and as soon as you bring out a new way for people to deploy new technologies that has adoption, that's where they really accelerate. That’s obviously the accelerations you've seen in blockchain today. In 2016 we just kept having to build server farms, build locations where you were going to build another new center. Physically building that yourself slows you down and we’re seeing this unused capacity. So for a long time we've had a business plan to be able to make use of spare computing but it was only as of 2016 containerization and finally got mature enough that we could move the workloads around that we wanted to. People were used to the sharing economy so research 2000 consumers across the UK about sixty of them said they would share their computing capacity to the market and we just saw from technology perspective that everything was in place. Broadband connectivity was now good enough and then finally the tool sets around blockchain and obviously you we're talking about Cosmos, they the best tool sets out there that you could build and adapt to blockchain. So all the technologies were coming together and we regularly had a couple of people coming to us and asking about putting mining equipment in our datescenters. As it happened, we weren't in Iceland or other locations that are a much better place to put it but it just got us interested in the space that we were learning as we were going along so we sold that business to build previously where we physically had to build it ourselves, we’d sold their business so now we could build it in software so that everyone could run on everyone else's in structure.

[00:16:15] Citizen Cosmos: Did you personally find out about crypto because of the mining thing? 

[00:16:18] Matt: That’s where I got my first involvement but my CTO had been one of the first bitcoin miners. He knew about it well before I got involved. 
[00:16:37] Citizen Cosmos: When you first heard about crypto, what did you think? Did youthink this is kind of ponzi scheme or it was interesting?

[00:16:48] Matt: I'm a technologist, so I was really interested in understanding it when I started seeing the Bitcoin mining. I was really behind this and then started doing the research and was getting more and more into understanding the technology and understanding its power. I realized that actually this is probably one of the biggest innovations, blockchain itself. Ii think it's got the power to achieve the same as the internet has over the next twenty years which is for me as a technologist is really exciting. The journey that I've done over the previous fifteen years had made me do it again. 

[00:17:31] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting that you mentioned this before similarities between development of what's going on in the blockchain space now to what you saw before with the internet. I remember very well how the internet was developing, how computing was developing,  especially private computing after nineties already and in the beginning of the 2000s the similarities were astonishing in terms of cscalability especially and l2s. By the way, why Cosmos? How did you choose the blockchain to work with? 


[00:18:20] Matt: We did look at the options to start with: can this be built on someone else's blockchain, could it be built on a Etherium? Obviously, the cost of Etherium is prohibitive for many types of projects nowadays and we need much higher performance than Etherium and obviously we were nowhere near the future release of Etherium and we looked at a few other blockchains as well, but we understood that we needed to have our own chain and then the option is entirely build your own chain from scratch or you take a tool set that exists. I think probably two the best toolsets out there are Cosmos SDK and Substrate and we looked at the options between those two. Substrate still had a lot of tie to the core network and it was much harder to customize if you really want to adapt it a lot and change it for your own purposes. But we wanted to build an infrastructure blockchain that's accessible by all other blockchains in which case Cosmos by far has got the best interconnects, the IBC connections between every other zone that's on there and  the technology that they've used its very similar to BGE which is kind of how the internet was designed back in the early days what still is obviously and we were seeing the similarities and that model is proven and the way they the communications across IBC and transfer sets is similar to packet and encaptulation so it was a space that we knew very well but in the in the internet domainand we could just see that that model is going to scale better than any other model that I had seen in the blockchain space. It had the best interconnect potential going forwards, it had the best toolset to be able to adapt it and I think you know that outweighed pretty any other areas that are still playing catch up and I think from a road map perspective they've got some good releases coming out over the next few quarters about optimizations. We’ve even seeing limitation on some of the other chains at much lower levels than was expected but the Cosmos chains are holding up pretty well even when we've seen the issues with UST and other platform, the protocol managed to survive the entire time. It was just th correct solution and as we're a tech stack, we wanted to build a platform that anyone could build the entire solution. So at the moment if you want to build a a render you have to build a layer one yourself. But that's a huge barrier to entry where we have designed the network so that you can build one of those essentially as adapt with an image that you can then scale out to nodes around the world, running this infrastructure, it enables other projects to very quickly build infrastructure solutions that typically in the past have taken a very long time and Cosmos enabled us to do that, so we've built it where you can build your own native tokens, you can have NFTs, we use Cosmos for the smart contract but we do have EVM coming in as well. 

[00:21:53] Citizen Cosmos: You mentioned an interesting point in the middle about that one of the things for choosing Cosmos was their model that they use is being proven to work with the internet and the internet still built that way. I have another devil's advocate question here, especially with your experience, you have seen the internet grow. Considering the internet is pretty decentralized but at the same time we have dns and http. Do you think that we might bump into something in the Cosmos technology which will lead instead of scalability to centralization in that sense in the sense that dns and https led to the centralization of the modern internet?

[00:23:18] Matt: I think there's no doubt that we will hit caps and limits in any technology. You always find a limit and usually then it gets up graded or we are connected so that's kind of inevitable with any technology solution. It's the fact that you can upgrade that, or improve that
before it becomes a critical issue. The way i guess the cause is decay
is built is that one is independent so at least if you are hitting errors you know you're not going to take down the whole network which is the most important thing and that is one of the key architecture designs. That's the way every service provider kind of has called a number but it's the equivalent of how we do and IBC between two blockchains. You can only mess with your own network and then those improvements like md5 are a way of improving the ability to make sure the communications are correct between them. So I think the roadmap is good and there's constant areas of improvement from technology from that perspective from a centralization perspective. I think probably the biggest centralization really is the development team that are working on it but it's also very open and people can it pars and add to it as well the relays.  There're multiple relays out there and I think relayers are very good in comparison to dns host where you've got close to service providers that are direct name records but then in the back of it you know you've got your higher up name services usually you only lose your local name service so the people or the domains directly connected to it go down but that's why you have secondary and nursery DNS. I think that's something that should be built in slightly better on IBC. You can have live secondary and tertiary links so if you do lose a relayer it’s pretty much transparent and you would go straight on to a second one that would fail. As I understand that it's a lot of more of a manual process and if you get to that point you've got a self-healing network that works much better and then relayers i mean you're always going to have single points of risk in any design. It's kind of how do you handle those failover solutions.

[00:25:35] Citizen Cosmos: The most simple solution here is just introduce rewards for relayers, that they have an incentive not to look for other models like the dns hosts did. Do you  plan any incentives for for relayers on Cudos in terms of the network itself? Is there any talks about it
or ideas that you guys have?

[00:26:04] Matt: Not directly. For relayers we have incententive validators naturally on the network, we are bringing up our own relayer at the moment as well connect into a number of new channels as a connecting to a third party relayer and using their connections. I wouldn't have an objection and I think it's a good idea in the same way that validators take a cut of transactions that go through relayers. I have seen in the SDK roadmap that is a proposal as well that there will be the ability for them to add so I think that's a really good thing. It's fine initially for people to be able to do things for free but they're not sustainable at the end of the day and if the relayers then have the choice to set it up and they could be small percentages for someone that runs a bridge where you transfer assets between the two. So I think people are comfortable with that model, it's just it's not very easy to do at the moment. I wouldn't have a problem, I assume people are in the same mind because that's how validatos work and that's how they're incentivized.

[00:27:08] Citizen Cosmos: Talking about validators, and I'm sorry for being a bit on the controversial side of the questions today but currently if I go on the big deeper explorer, I'm only seeing twenty six validators and I think that it is eighty percent of the stake is top five validators on Cudos. Do you have plans to attract more validators to the project to decentralize the stake from the top?

[00:27:59] Matt: We were looking to have around 30 validators for genesis which was only a few weeks ago and we had about 70-80 validators sign up on testnet so we're now going back to those and start to onboard the other validatos that we've been working with. So we've not looked to initiate that just in the first few weeks just to make sure everything is as stable as expected. We spent nine months in QA just making sure everything was correct and in the way the network had been designed and then we would start to go back and get the validatators coming back on. So the intention is to get that up kind of over the next six or twelve months to about eighty or so and then as that happens, that will be a match. 

[00:28:36] Citizen Cosmos: It sure does build up. I have seen some networks to manage to attract a lot straight away but mostly I've seen especially now the space is growing and there's
more networks and more validators but at the same time the space is more competitive. I think it does take time for a network to attract it it's like the best validators that it wants to attract that will definetely bring value to the network. I read in the documentation that you need a certain amount of Cudos to start a validator. I think it was two million, correct me if I'm wrong which is at today's prices roughly 20k dollars. Do you think it's important to have a minimum amount to stake in order to prevent spam attacks or do you think that minimum amount to stake puts boundary on decentralization because then anyone can start if they have the equipment or is ddos prevention is more important in this case for the network?

[00:29:40] Matt: I think for the way that tendermint is designed, you should have a minimum if you really want a stable core network. So we're probably a little bit different to other chains where we use tendermint as a layer one network and then we use our compute network to
scale out the compute demand so on the core network we run governant bridge in smart contracts consensus on the compute network and then that's limited to currently around a 100 validators that you want to run on that design and then the computer work isn't limited on the number of nodes that can kind of just keep scaling because you always take a sacrifice between performance security transactions. So we split it into two so we could take the benefits of each. On the core network it is very important that those nodes are as stable as possible even though tendermint fails over pretty well and to have that then you should have service providers that are able to that kind of stake those number of tokens and be able to put that investment in to commit on to the platform. Many of our validators are very experienced in the Cosmos space which means they help your support, they help your community, now they'll help other people coming onboard as well. I think certainly for the early stages to kind of an individual home user that's quite too much but to a business and typically most of these validators are the datacenter providers and web2 providers, seasoned web3 validators. They have nodes that are very stable, they have high performance networks, many of them ddos protected, so they've kind of got everything you need in place to have that really scalable core global network.

[00:31:29] Citizen Cosmos: Of course, as a validator we also validate and we also definitely try to pay more and more and more attention as we go to he infrastructure to make sure it’s as stable as one can get. The dream for our validators is to also go green and I really like that you mentioned it,  and to be as independent as possible, to be less dependent on electricity, less dependent on the internet cables and so on and so forth. Of course something has to be done but it's great to hear that there are more and more people with the same interests. Let’s talk about Akash. To somebody who comes from the outside and hears about cloud computing and Cosmos, the first
name that bprings to mind is Akash. What are the differences between Cudos and Akash? 

[00:32:30] Matt: I think Akash is a good network and I like what they've done. I think they've taken a different approach. We come from previously building a large global cloud network, so we've sort of come into it purely from that mindset and because of that we've decided that we service both market service: web2 and web3. The web2 has different expectations than the web3. When you scale on web3 you expect to scale in your smart contract, you expect to be able to pay in crypto in the smart contract itself and to be able to get all of the information directly into that smart contract, whereas in the web2 space they expect GUI or an API, they expect support mechanisms that support teams, everything else that you get from an enterprise. So we designed ours to be able to service both of these. It’s growing at 3 billion per year, about a 100 billion this year is that size of that market so that's a very big space for us to address and that’s probably where we are working with much larger providers in that space. Our typical customers spend somewhere between a few thousand dollars to probably two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month on cloud. So we designed it to service that typical market an that's the market that we used to sell to when we ran our last company so were kind of very familiar with and then in the web3, areas that we focused on this kind of scale so average metaverse needs around a 150 players per node so if you want a million players you're looking at
something like 7000 servers always fixed IP addresses is distributed around the world so we've been building this to do the same performance as the large hyper sailors to scale up to iit but using web3 technology it's quite a different approach from that perspective. 

[00:34:32] Citizen Cosmos: Considering the last  five to six years in the blockchain space there were a lot of projects in the cloud computing area and a lot of them failed. You can still find them on CoinGecko, for example, it’s hard to kill a blockchain. You mentioned that you have 600 users so you already have a huge base. But the question is why do you think you will succeed in such a hugely difficult competition? 

[00:35:46] Matt: In my view, a lot have failed failed because purely targeted web3 market you could only use the native token. When you connect your wallet the transactions and you try and go through and you try to run a transaction it doesn't do anything. Some of them which exist now, got two or three demo apps that work where you can actually do anything. There's no real incentive to use the platformю It's all about incentives today. If you look in web3, the need is growing very much in AI, and metaverse, and game servers but in the web2 space the need is already there. So what's the need to move or what's the incentive rather to move across? In most of these projects there is no incentive and they've gone purely web3 and there's currently no market. The problem with coming into a space so early is it would have been much harder to do this three years ago. So in this previous blockchain cycle I matched that a little bit too off limited version of SP and other markets where you see the dot com boom and then all the good
projects come out of it but it takes a few years for those good projects to start getting adoption. If you look at Google, they were coming in just as the market was taking off but it still takes time to adoption so I think they haven't really focused on the wants and the needs of the market. I think they've gone straight for the technology and there's some and if you look at some of the other applications that are vertical based, some of them have tried to go to the traditional markets but then there's no incentive to use, it just using a standard video render provider, so we decided instead to come up with a network that is able to service web2 be more cost effective and more efficient and greener and then we also came up with a network able to scale for web3 because that's sort of the two gaps and that's what we focused on. All the other projects out there that we have seen didn't really take a market first approach. Anything that you build, you need to understand the wants and the need of the user before you build it.

[00:37:58] Citizen Cosmos: I really love the answer! I was around building in 2016-2017 already some projects and we were building social network and we didn't go for the market at all and a lot of the projects were not looking at the market, and unfortunately most of those who were looking at the market back then were like ponzis.  A lot of those small projects really didn't care about marketing. You mentioned 600k users. That is huge! Are you planning to onboard them? 

[00:39:08] Matt: They actually all signed up for the service and a few hundred thousand of those have been in the software as well but what we did before our blockchain was ready was paying the out Bitcoin and Ethereum so they had a liquid token. But once our blockchain has gone live, we now integrate in the payouts on all of these devices being out early in the Cudos with incentives as well. So that means that anyone that connects their hardware to the network can be earning Cudos depending on what the application doing and the types of work, things like integrating compute into that application. So we sort of built things in modules and stages and integrating them together. All of those in the next few weeks will be able to earn the token and you can just go and download the application. Once we have compute added to a home games
machine can be earning 200 pounds a month from expecting computing so we're working besides on supply and demand on the network. Our real route to market on that side is working with big providers. We've got a partnership with a company called Tingo which is an African telecom provider. Over the next 6 or 12 months were bringing on 20 million users with that partnership and they're going to be wallet holders so that's going to be a lot of customers wallet
holders that we're going to have been integrated into the application and they're actually mobile phones so we release in a mobile phone version of our software so we can make use of that spare computing. A big usage of our network has now become tokenization so we've got things like tokenization of carbon credits, solar power, fostering plastics recycling, so they also get access to any other tokens that are running on network but also if someone that's got those applications is then provided in solar themselves, they can earn in token or if they're providing other services they can earn in those tokens. We very much believe in Metcalfe’s law and scaling the size of the users in the network will naturally scale the adoption of the network, so we're working a lot in education as well across Africa and other regions, getting the   education layer. So people that are getting into blockchain, learning to develop. We are becoming one of those parts of educational curriculum for  the people to build on top.

[00:41:38] Citizen Cosmos: That's pretty cool that you guys are thinking about impact as well!  
There's a lot of mention of gaming and Cudos. You also mentioned gaming during the interview already a couple of times. What is the deal with Cudos and gaming?

[00:41:57] Matt: It originally came from a lot of games running our software because they're the highest earners. So the games machines are running good revenue out of their infrastructure but because of that we started working with a lot of games companies. We've actually got on board the two prior presidents of Sony Playstation so they brought all the way from Playstation 1 to 5. We're very much looking to bring releases on to console of our application as well. There’s over a 100 million Playstations out there so that's a very large network. We just see this as from a home users device that there's a lot of unused capacity there. Also on our board is Paul Manuel, he ran UK’s largest game server platform. We see it and all a multiplayer stateful games need fixed infrastructure so all comes between supply and demand, and we have also the native support for NFTs into our blockchain which means that you don't need to build your own smart contracts if you want to publish NFTs. It also means that they run faster and you don't need to audit your own contract as well so it makes it easier for games to integrate. Then, we've got Unity and Unreal plugins coming out to make it much easier to integrate into the game space. We’re deeply falling into that space through what we're doing. It's growing and growing.

[00:43:26] Citizen Cosmos: Makes a lot of sense. I have two more questions. When do you expect the compute power aspect to start?

[00:43:46] Matt: We've been releasing the different platforms in stages so the blockchain just went live last quarter so in Q2 that went live we intending in this quarter for compute to go, we've got two elements of compute. We've got service providers on there and we've got buyers on there but it's a closed beta in a group but we're actually looking to release integration into the bloc chain over the end of this quarter and that means that you will then be able to scale either directly via smart contracts or bridges and then you'll also be able to scale in traditional cloud methods over API and GUI as well. We've already built a whole interface so that people from traditional cloud can use it.

[00:44:30] Citizen Cosmos: The second question. How many users we will have at compute power launch? I think it's over a million users if I remember correctly.

[00:44:38] Matt: so the first version of the compute power is being released for the datacenter providers. So we're working with large data and providers that have got anything up to a few hundred thousand servers and integrating with them so we'll be able to provide a center scale but currently we're signing up about 14000 uses a month on the home use version as well, but that will be released later on. So we focused on building the datacenter and releasing that version very quickly after the mining version will be publicly available and then finally the consumer version and it's more technically challenging to an environment that isn't always there and has variable network. So it's just from a technical perspective we've been getting the other two first. 

[00:45:24] Citizen Cosmos: Pre-last question. When airdrop? 

[00:45:38] Matt: There are going to be incentives. We haven't finalized what those incentives are but basically what we're going to be rewarding with the numbers and quantities. The incentives will be based on developers building smart contracts and applications porting smart contracts from other rust chains. We are also doing grants as well which will be released in to get certain types of applications on platform. If people want to get involved in any types of airdrops and rewards, now is the time to create wallets on our platform start building and testing some smart contract, even just deploy one form other CosmWasm chains or templates that exist out there and just get used to actually building on our network also try using the native NFT support. So that's where we've managed to create some speed and cost fences and see what you can get there. We've got quite a lot of developer tooling which makes the journey quite easy for anyone that wants to build on top of it but now is the time to get involved. We will be announcing what's coming out.

[00:46:40] Citizen Cosmos: Last question. What keeps you motivated in your daily life and keeps you wanting to build Cudos? It could be anything. Maybe it's something that you do specifically, may be meditation, may be reading, maybe your family.


[00:47:27] Matt: I am fascinated by technology and I really like building hings that people can build on top and build together and build their own businesses which is what we did last time. What fascinates me about blockchain is just openness. The fact because everything is open, everything is transparent and there's so many standards that you can communicate with other platforms that never existed. It means the speed of  elevation now is much greater and faster
than has pretty much been possible on anything else that I've seen before. What keeps me going is my work, the ability to really do some positive impact. We have a really high goal which is to raise a billion for good causes but that can be good causes in computing that's provided to cancer research, it can be revenue and that's generated and donated to charities or individuals. There's a lot of motivation. We have a really big positive impact on the world and I think this is within my ability. What drives me is being able to achieve these things and blockchain made that possible. 

[00:49:13] Citizen Cosmos: I like that a lot. Matt, thank you so much for your time, it was a huge pleasure! Looking forward to the development of Cudos!
