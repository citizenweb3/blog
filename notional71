Transcript of the episode

[00:01:41] Citizen Cosmos: Hey everyone, welcome to a new episode of the Citizen Cosmos podcast! We have today with us Jacob Gadikian, founder of Notional, a disciplined software development validator. 

[00:02:07] Jacob Gadikian: Hi! It’s good to be here. So Notional was a uniswap airdrop and a computer that's sitting right over there and we're 20 people, it's pretty incredible actually. 

[00:02:13] Citizen Cosmos: 20? Wow! I have to be honest before the listeners, I prepared zero questions for Jacob because he’s a great guy and I tought the conversation is going to be free flow so this is why the conversation might seem a little bit lost it's not, we are on track. Please carry on with the introduction Jacob.

[00:02:53] Jacob Gadikian: So basically in February of 2021 several things happened. One, I left Tendermint and began to research dexes for a very real world physical commodities trading product and since that's still in play I'm gonna go into detail on that, that’s something I'm still consulting on. Initially I looked at applying the tools and techniques in the GravityDex. Somebody along the way said: “Jacob you really need to talk to Sunny, he's building something and he had invited me to a conference in 2019 but my son had just been born so I wasn’t able to attend. It was the last time I had spoke to him except for once at Tendermint. I sent him a Twitter DM and he told me we need to talk. So he and I had about an hour and a half long call where he introduced Osmosis to me and honestly my comprehension was very low, I never got into Ethereum DeFi except of course enough to deploy something very amateurish on to Ethereum which was enough to get me a very significant uniswap airdrop. I had spoken to Sunny and then one day I saw that Osmosis was about to launch and I threw in a Genesis transaction. Our up time was initially terrible, I was validating from my family's old apartment and we were getting 80% uptime. Initially, I created just some new documentation around seeds and peers and work down our network a bit and got that  up and made it very stable. That was when I first built an open MPTCP router and linked that up to another IASP in Vietnam. After that I explored relaying. I had my Osmosis validator and we started to get requests to back up on relaying. So I did the majority of relaying that summer and this actually got me down. It's now 14 months long rabbit hole in Cosmos performance so my computer has a ridiculously fast hard drive, it's an Intel p5800x. Anyhow, U quickly learned from observing that rate actually slowed things down, and because of the stripe size on it, the chain would keep trying to write all these small files smaller than the 32 kbs but the striped size of the rate was 32 kbs. I was relying against our validator node, you should not do this if you want to learn how to relay. Please do not follow these directions it was not safe. I had the relayer running I had three or four validators on that computer. What I noticed was that when IBC packets would build up, the validators would miss blocks and I was relaying a fairly significant portion of the whole IBC networks packets. I was also trying to figure out why our packets would come in faster than Cephalopods packets, they were trying to figure that out too. Also, that was not consistent but there was just
this tendency, turns out that Cosmos chains would just show up disusage and it's only in the past month that we put this issue to bed. There is still a lot more performance things to fix in Cosmos but at least on the database layer, myself, three Notional team members, we refactored heavily the database that the Cosmos SDK uses tore almost everything out, it’s 75% lighter and introduced a new data bates called Pebble DB. Now, along the way sometime around September 2021 I stopped doing things dangerously and began to formalize operations. I
separated validation and relaying. Validation was strictly on-site, relaying was strictly at Hetzer.  I think this is about the time that we really began to grow. In May of 2021 I met an amazing young individual and he built Notional’s engineering team. They are technology students and so they began to help with the process of formalizing operations and making things safer. To do that we had to write code. The infrastructure operations weren't enough, we could get the fastest disk in the world and not get much of a speed boost from it. We knew that we were really dependent on speed, particularly for relaying and then on faster chains. Because that thing is so fast there's an additional operational burden there. Evmos is fairly similar, it's just a very fast blockchain, and we began to specialize in that. Then, along the way, in about January of 2020 I had been working on Juno I was told that there’s a chain they're going to build it with StarPort and it could be launched on StarPort network. That part didn't really play out but what I would do for 10 months, I'd go between Juno and the StarPort template and I'd update the template for every time that I saw that Juno had sort of fallen behind the latest versions of the Cosmos core libraries. So by fall of 2021 we were doing more and more with Osmosis, we were collaborating with a number of teams although I'm going to give credit where credit is due even though it's as controversial, we never really got paid by Terra but a lot of the database stuff that we worked on definitely came from a long string of interactions that actually included Do Kwon because we had just launched Chihuahua chain, I was working on the database yet again. I thought it would be good idea to record a video barking like Chihuahua about the speed of the chain and I did and shared it. 

[00:11:47] Citizen Cosmos: Just to point out, literally nobody got paid by Do Kwon, everybody got minused by him. Even if you got paid by Do Kwon, you still probably got put it back in a way. 

[00:12:04] Jacob Gadikian: Yeah there was a certain recycling effect. Luckily, we weren’t directly exposed. Of course the indirect exposure was still horrific. A lot of Cosmos went down by 80-90% and during that week I was actually watching the chain, I still suspect that the chain was attacked at the same time the chains economy was attacked. Really weird things happened across their validator set. 

[00:12:38] Citizen Cosmos: I must say that it’s great to hear your side of things after different conversations with guys from Cephalopods. 

[00:13:04] Jacob Gadikian: so look i'll take a second here to praise Cephalopod and what informal did for IBC in the beginning. IBC is very huge and complex and probably needs
to be. The key base level of IBC is 2 tendermint chains exchanging light clients. After that the protocol pretty much mirrors tcpip and it’s a good analogy for anybody who is technical looking into it. At the time it was Hermes that worked well. Since then Strangelove has done a very deep refactor on the go relayer. Go relayer version 2.0 was very reliable and very performant. In the summer of 2021 though it was just Hermes and a lot of things broke. In fact, things broke constantly. You would see channels get backed up. Nobody knew why, we just had our guesses.  
I think the thing that I was right about was the influence of hardware. One of the things that we figured out or added evidence to was that there were situations where Hermes would work really well but I don't think that we know to this day what caused some of those issues because what happened was we decoupled IBC from the SDK in version 43. Version 43 was pulled back and then 44 was released. Osmosis ran 44 for a bit. I helped to upgrade Osmosis to 45  and I
think that's when IBC 2 was released. What I mean is that in original Ismosis which kicked off the big explosion in IBC, there were many issues that I believe are still undiagnosed. We had a bunch of guesses I’m sure that those guesses fed into both the IBC spec and then the IBC code, and now I would say that the big deal presently is that we’re integrating CosmWasm and IBC to a much greater degree so that if a chain is a computer and another chain is a computer, then you have applications on each computer. Those contracts can talk to each other and that's the stage where we are now. So how did we get to 20 people?  Along the way our focus shifted. Initially we were mainly an operator. We learned how to run relayers and run them really well, we also helped to teach people how to run relayers and we then began to write code and that led to a number of different engineering contracts through out the ecosystem and presently we support Osmosis, Juno, Pylon’s craft economy and we’re pushing out SDK-46 across the ecosystem and working on performance sothat's how we ended up at  20 people and we will likely move to a new office this or next month and that's the story. 

[00:17:56] Citizen Cosmos: There is one thing here I would like to ask you. I would love to talk about what makes you tick and what keeps you motivated in governance, in trying to makes things fair for everybody, etc. What is the push forward? 

[00:19:40] Jacob Gadikian: Frankly, some of the things that I've seen around Cosmos self-development are not really up to the Osmosis standard but I hate for anybody to think i'm just baselessly protecting Osmosis. The Hub was kicked off Cosmos and many people probably don't know this but I was a validator and I noticed that the Hub had much more little sized environment. If we’re talking about delegations, this is actually getting taken care of, there was there a validator doing some nasty things to Gaia, ICF, they withdrew their delegation which is the appropriate thing to do. So I noticed that the allegations were really off and that builders were not being supported the way that they were on Osmosis. Furthermore, if we go to something that I've spoken about many times on Twitter, there's just one random string, no  name, no contact, 20% commission, no governance participation, frequent downtime - basically everything is bad about a validator but it still had a very significant ICF delegation and I questioned that and unfortunately along the way of questioning that seems to have harmed relationships and Ihope that that can be mended. I'm going to defend myself and say that those things need to be taken care of and they were not addressed in a serious manner when I first approached them. I first approached them in a very limited semi-private context and I was told literally to let the professionals handle it - they didn't. 

[00:21:28] Citizen Cosmos: I love that  sentence: let the professional handle it.
 

[00:21:39] Jacob Gadikian: Yeah. Well you know that's more or less how I felt about it and I think that in a healthier environment things like that would not harm relationships. I found and eventually resolved only through working with the code reviewers, one of them accused me of code of conduct violations for tweeting too much during proposal 69. I don't want to name names and I'm not interested in further damaging relationships, I'm interested in building relationships where we can say that  there was pretty serious problem with the Hub where it would always pass. I really want to give credit where it's due so Cosmos SDK team, IBC team, they really did an incredible job around helping me get code that touched on the usability of SDK-46 because Notional invested tremendous amount of energy money time in building out chains on SDK-46 and one of the byproducts of that so we've put up the only chain on 46 that's Pylon’s and that will soon be going from testnet to mainnet, it's a chain that allows cards to be accepted. We have been building craft economy on SDK-46 since fall last year and more recently there was some highly inaccurate information spread about governance and I want  to have fact driven conversations about all this stuff. I feel that politics have been taken over and I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings. I genuinely care about the Cosmos Hub, Cosmos overall and I do think that because I raised these issues Notional has been treated wrong and at scale that is very disappointing. We rewrote tmdb, there has been no recognition of that, we have created tooling to automatically find unclosed iterators in chains which turned out to be a relatively common issue that was affecting database performance all across Cosmos and at the end of the day if we're kind of cast aside will just go and work out on Osmosis and Juno. In my opinion this has just been a misuse of our time and I do not feel that it is disrespectful to point out that during all the debates around CosmWasm. When you enable CosmWas chain you double its system resource consumption. This is just that's just how it is. We love Cosmos at Notional. In terms of features and functions against CosmWasm on the Hub my views don't match Jay's views there and one of the things that was repeatedly tossed out during the debate was that I was some kind of a proxy for him. He's the guy who taught me all of this. I've had a long succession of teachers and that that's how you learn. In Cosmos there is a very non-formal mentorship. It was Jay, it was Alessio, it were other members of the Tendermint team including Dennis - head of StarFort, it was Jack. Jack noticed I was doing a lot of IBC traffic. He called me
one day pretty much out of the blue and said: “How are you doing this? I don't think you know how it works.” Then he spent about two weeks making sure I knew how IBC worked. Obviously that's a really big deal, he invested a lot of time in that. After that it was Dave from Osmosis. When I began to work on the chain he spent tons of time making sure that I knew what the hell : is going on under the hood because I came in fairly green. I’m a former history teacher and Bitcoin miner. I've learned a lot of technical stuff.

[00:26:30] Citizen Cosmos: This is interesting. I want to know your story, man. I know I'm putting you a little bit off the track but I would love to hear how you began loving hardware, where did the love was born on. So what’s the story? Where did it start? 


[00:27:21] Jacob Gadikian: It's a little bit long but I'll go right into it. I was teaching history in China. It was a private high school program where the students would eventually go to school in the United States and it was really cool, I got to actually do the curriculum design. But during that time Xi Jinping became president of China and stuff changed quite a bit. I don't know a lot about Chinese politics but two really notable things changed. If you work in a school in China you have contact with the government  by necessity. This school was considered to be a pilot program and there were just mixed opinions. Secondly, the curriculum teaching style were affected and politics course became mandatory and from my perspective I really wanted to learn about all that stuff, hat's not my point of view. I found it very interesting because one thing that did happen in China was really rapid human advancement at scale. That's notable and probably shouldn't be ignored. In any time you're ooking at what China is today, you should be thinking about mega cities, you should be thinking about the advancement in human development, you should probably also be thinking about the double-edged sword. The really negative part about this for me is that for a time I got separated from my family by the great firewall. This is probably how you and I met online by the way. So it's also how I started to use Bitcoin. China made the great firewall far more strict and about my interest in hardware and electronics, I’ve been doing that all my life. So in China I was actually testing and collecting all kinds of weird interesting Chinese electronics because it's all made there so you can get some really neat stuff there and I met along the way cos as several companies based in Shenzhen whose products I like. So in the middle of my first year teaching that's when Xi Jinping took power.  For a brief time I was not really able to easily contact my family, there are ways to do it of course, but it became difficult and certainly couldn't have a call like we’re having now. So I learned to build VPNs because the commercial one was not reliable. I wasn't really concerned with privacy either, I was more about connectivity. This is what led me into Bitcoin, I found out about MadeSafe, I participated in the ICO and somehow it led into bit shares of Fuzzy. I came on the Fuzzy show in 2013 or 2014. By the end of my second year teaching I had invested in Bitcoin, really rolled in all the coins and I lost a great deal of that play money of course. Then, I decided to quit teaching, moved down to Shenzhen and decided to make open-source hardware because these wallets and private keys it’s the hardware we run. The keys are always vulnerable and there we got about a six month crash course in really like why hardware isn't open source or more accurately why opensource software hardware is crazy hard. What you have if you look at the arm CPU market people license the arm design those drivers are proprietary. Intel is relatively similar they protect things at different levels in the stack until drivers are all open but Intel’s PCB reference designs are all closed and then certainly the semi conductor material in both cases is closed. All of that failed and enter weird politic stuff again, my visa ran out during the umbrella revolution so I went from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, I'm down there for a week or two,nyou could taste the pepper spray in the air just about everywhere and it looked like it was going to turn violent and in many ways it
did turn violent of course. But I felt that it could easily get more violent than it already was. Additionally there were counterprotesters, they were doing things like juggling knives in menacing ways on street corners. Eventually I realized this isn't going to stop, the government offices are closed, I can't renew my Chinese visa, if I'd have stayed another week I probably could have had it but eventually decided this is not going to work because I was just there
to renew my visa, it was going to be a very straightforward thing and I flew down to Saigon where I failed again and ended up in Hanoi for two and a half years and that's how I ended up coming here again, this time I got stuck here for Covid and then in the middle part I visited Cambodia for Steemet South East Asia meet up. It was just a small meat up that another Steemet user made but me and my colleagues were writing on Steemer and making great money with it, decided to go to Cambodia. If you check my Steemet post, you'll find that I found some bugs and what it turned out to be is Steemet using the JavaScript 256k1 implementation. I changed my view, I thought it was insecure, it's non canonical. So there's a way that you're supposed to use that library, Steemet doesn't use it in that way and they're very prescriptive about how to use that library and that's how I found Jay Kwon. I was researching proof of state consensus mechanisms so that I could try to make a replacement for Steemet, it was called down and I was having mental health trouble but I didn't know it and that's the scariest thing
about going crazy. You will not know it if you're really going off the deep end. I was but I didn't know it. Probably I had undiagnosed bi-polar for 15 years. Long story short it all culminates in
that crazy thing with me stealing a giant truck full of sand in Phnom Penh. I was delusional, I don't precisely know how or why I felt that I needed to steal transportation, then drive that transportation to China. These were my overriding priorities in life, greater than food, greater than anything and I attempted to do that for about a week and I was eventually successful. That's probably not a very good thing, I nearly drove into a parade but luckily I had no murderous intent and I stopped the truck. Then I got my ass kicked by a giant mob of people and went to jail. Ine of the most interesting and heart warming part of this story is the that the truck’s owner apparently came to see me in jail, took one look at my crazy ass and within a day the U.S. embassy had come picked me up and took me to a psychiatric hospital. There they tried everything except for actually what helped me. To  this day I religiously take lithium but there they put me on every downer type of drug that you can imagine and it didn’t work, but then they got me into an airplane after about two weeks and so I flew from from Phnom Penh to Buffalo with a doctor who was feeding me pills the entire time and so he got me to the Buffalo psychiatric center and I was genuinely helped by this stuff, I wouldn't be here today if it if things
hadn't gone in this way. 

[00:40:06] Citizen Cosmos: I can relate very much to the story. The first time I was diagnosed with bi-polar was 18 years ago, when I was about 17-18 years old. I think I  decided when I was 18 that is going to be my prerogative and my battle and I refused to take pills that I was prescribed, all the downers. I never did and I think that's what helped me to keep it. But again with bi-polar it's a very loud sentence to say because you have obviously very different level of bi-bolar disorder and the way it develops from the first to the fourth stage of course. I'm trying to connect here everything, your history teaching, the Chinese government changes, the love for the hardware and what I see and hear there have been misjudgments which you saw with the Chinese government and how they started to treat the inability to contact you family and that to me calls as if the governance goes wrong,  if nobody says anything in the right time and doesn't try to do something, that's what's going to happen.  

[00:41:55] Jacob Gadikian: I should expand on that. So I was in Iraq war protest. It was the dumbest, most futile thing I've ever done. Technically speaking that's the first time I was arrested but they didn't book it, I was in Chicago and I was literally put in plastic handcuffs and taken to the other side of the city and jumped out and it was pointless. What I mean is what I was doing at the time carrying around and talking about war, it was pointless because there
was a giant apparatus of lies backing up that conflict. I am really sensitive to governance issues and also to the accuracy of information that affects governance and maybe just give you  another dot to connect. Going back to the whole mental health situation I made it miraculously and in my mind statistically unlikely recovery. Most of the people that I met in the mental hospital I don't think that they recovered and they got the same treatment but did not recover. But I did. I Had a lot of help from my family but here's a deal. I began to take lithium in summer of 2017 and by fall of 2017 I was figuring out how to raise on venture capital when you just stole a
giant truck full of sand. We were successful. Drone energy raised a million dollars from all kinds investors and I believe has actually raised another round now.  The business worked and that's one of the reasons why I'm so comfortable speaking openly about that experience because for good reasons investors will look into your background, they will ask you questions about it. It's substantial amount of money, they want to know that you're not going to invest in sand trucks instead of Bitcoin mines. So I learned to tell the facts on that. It's a very relationship based business, you're seeking capital to purchase equipment and you are sourcing energy contracts that's the business. I ended up doing a lot of that, I learned to be very direct about things even if they're uncomfortable and it's not especially the first 75 times because when you raise venture capital don't talk to one investor, you don't do this once you do that many times and find the
ones that you click with so the first 75 times were hard but after that not really. It's just another piece of my history that just has to be incredibly fact driven about. Otherwise, why would anybody trust me? Frankly, if I were to try to hide that, they shouldn't trust me.

[00:45:38] Citizen Cosmos: I’d like to say that all you just said come as a battling bi-polar 
and succeeding because to me those swings that are uncontrollable, are something I want to control. I don't trust those swings and I don’t want to trust them. And that's why I would rather be
direct and say this is what I am, these are my minused, these are my pluses. This is how I’ve been living my life for many years , over 20 years and it calls back straight away the things how I see the world, how I interact with the planet and I understand it very well.

[00:46:55] Jacob Gadikian: That's interesting that we both share that. I failed over and over until I started taking lithium. I do still experience bi-polar sometimes, sleep is very hard. I don't have the world's most regular or normal sleep schedule but I sleep every day and I wouldn't need to and I'm not sure that most people can relate to  that but I could just keep going but they said that's dangerous. I look after the whole sleep thing. My wife checks in on it, that's really important, I give her a lot of credit for my being alive, she sort of just chased me around Cambodia for about 6 months getting me out all kinds of messed up crazy ridiculous shit. So I got back up on my feet in the States and started to make plans to marry her. So we’re now married and live in Hanoi, we have a kid and trying to have another kid.  So to answer your question though I have seen that since I was young. I was 18 when I was at that Iraq war
protest and it left a big impression on me.

[00:48:54] Citizen Cosmos: You're gonna laugh but the first protest I went to was in 2003 was against the war in Iraq. That’s very ironic. 

[00:49:22] Jacob Gadikian: So now just about being rigorously fact-driven and then in the blockchain space you only talk about this issue because it's solved. This was also true of the Cosmos SDK, it had a number of CI jobs that hadn't fired in years. It was a program to check the code, one of them is called a Linter. The result was that no matter what you did various things that were supposed to check and test the code they would always tell you everything
is all good. We fixed the SDK and then moved on to Gaia and I don't want to be a pariah because I was very insistent that the delegations were screwed up and  they were harming governance. It affected Quorum quite a bit because of the lack of governance participation among recipients of ICF delegations. If I found it I can't leave it to the professionals, I must be the professional because it wasn't being addressed.  We need to focus on the code, we need to focus on transparency and go public.

[00:54:12] Citizen Cosmos: I think it’s important to hear an unbiased opinion. But regardless of that, we haven't opened up a lot of things but I would love to ask you about your motivation. What keeps you wanting to get off bed? With all you mentioned it’s not easy for anyone with struggle like yours. 

[00:59:27] Jacob Gadikian: I guess it goes back to the Iraq war protest. I really do think that governments worldwide are fairly fundamentally flawed and that transparency would solve a lot. I recently voted for 5% minimum of commission on the Hub and I am a very big supporter of markets. One thing that I've found really frustrating throughout career as an entrepreneur is incorporation and capital formation processes and I think most start-ups fail and loose 100% investment capital. It's only a moral issue when there isn't a genuine effort given and in that  casethat's like fraud or a scam and chains are not companies. There’s also Dig. Dig is a project based on readme files: we’re going to put physical plots on chain, we're going to sell those physical plots of land and we're going to excell because of transparency. That project suffered tremendously because of the conflict in Ukraine. We definitely overinvested in that market but there is a very specific reason and probably if I was  faced with the same set of decisions
again I’d probably make the same decisions because they had the legal structures that they
had put in place just, before the war for martial law was put into place and actually made the Dig  project o100% legal so we would have been able to do everything, the whole nine yards without question. So at present what we've done is we upgrade Dig SDk-46, we have added CosmWasm to Dig and we’ll be making an upgrade to it in the next couple of weeks as soon as IBC if finilzed. 

[01:02:22] Citizen Cosmos: Back to the original question. What does keep you get out of bed? 

[01:02:29] Jacob Gadikian: It's just the creation of transparent systems. I'm a true believer in the style of governance that we have in Cosmos chains even though it's messy and imperfect I
think that the current set up can be extended a great deal. One of the reasons I love SDK-46 because it did extend governance, we can do that more in 47. 
[01:03:47] Citizen Cosmos: On that note I would like to wrap this episode up because you had an important point that somehow concludes what we’ve been talking about. Thanks very much and hopefully we can speak again!
