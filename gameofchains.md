Citizen Cosmos is participating in Game of Chains, we are in the Active set there and already made 2 tasks.

**So, what is Game of Chains?**

Game of Chains is the latest public incentivized Interchain Security testnet - probably the most important technology in Cosmos since IBC. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub. Because the market cap of Cosmos Hub is large, small projects will use Cosmos Hub's security to secure its own PoS chain.

Concumer chains (chains that will use Hub's security) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set. Game of Chains will help validators to understand ICS and help to find any bugs.

**The testnet infrastructure is include:**

- Provider chain
- Multiple consumer chains
- IBC relayers
- Support services

Game of Chains will last over the next 2-4 weeks and will end in the end of November. Validators will complete a series of tasks that prove their proficiency at running the ICS protocol. In each phase, points will be awarded to validators who complete certain tasks. In the end of campaign, the best validators will be eligible for rewards.

This public testnet is funded via Prop77, so validators are competing for 20000 ATOMs reward

Citizen Cosmos is already completed 2 tasks and we are looking forward to test the ICS further!
