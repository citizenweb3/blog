**What is the Game of Chains?**

[Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) is one of the main features being added to the Cosmos Hub as the platform transitions to the next phase of development. Interchain Security (ICS) is a complex technology that needs to be tested.

[Game of Chains](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022#phase-1-two-dummy-chains) is a public, incentivized, Interchain Security testnet, which has been launched on November 8.

Interchain Security allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub. 

If the Cosmos Hub has a large market cap, smaller projects may rent its security. Consumer chains (chains that will use Hub's security) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set.

The benefits of ICS for the Cosmos ecosystem:
- Chains can spend less time on thinking about where to hire reputable and concetrate more on building
- [Validators](https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/cosmos-hub?modal=validator&chain=cosmoshub-4&validator_address=cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) will benefit as they can attract delegators from new chains and get a part of their tokens (delegators will also receive the extra rewards)

Game of Chains will help validators to understand ICS and help to find any bugs. It is designed to fulfill two purposes: (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the ICS protocol.

**The testnet infrastructure includes:**

- Provider chain
- Multiple consumer chains
- IBC relayers
- Support services

Game of Chains will end in the end of November. In each phase, points will be awarded to validators who complete certain tasks. In the end of campaign, the best validators will be eligible for rewards, which are funded by [Prop77](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/77), with 20000 ATOMs.
