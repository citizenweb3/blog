**So, what is Game of Chains?**

Interchain Security is one of the main features being added to the Cosmos Hub as the platform transitions to the next phase of development. Interchain Security (ICS) is a complex technology that needs to be tested.

Game of Chains is the latest public incentivized Interchain Security testnet, which has been launched on November 8.

Interchain Security allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub. Because the market cap of Cosmos Hub is large, small projects will use Cosmos Hub's security to secure its own PoS chain. Consumer chains (chains that will use Hub's security) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set.

The benefits of ICS for the Cosmos ecosystem:
- Chains will be more reliable and secured by trusted validators
- The validation process is not going to be a distraction for validators to building their products workflow
- ATOMâ€™s sustainability will rise
Validators also will benefit as they can attract delegators from new chains and get a part of their tokens. 

Game of Chains will help validators to understand ICS and help to find any bugs.

**The testnet infrastructure includes:**

- Provider chain
- Multiple consumer chains
- IBC relayers
- Support services

Game of Chains is designed to fulfill two purposes:
(1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions
(2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the ICS protocol

Game of Chains will last over the next 2-4 weeks and will end in the end of November. Validators will complete a series of tasks that prove their proficiency at running the ICS protocol. In each phase, points will be awarded to validators who complete certain tasks. In the end of campaign, the best validators will be eligible for rewards.

This public testnet is funded via Prop77, so validators are competing for 20000 ATOMs reward
