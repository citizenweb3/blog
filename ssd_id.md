###  What is a self-sovereign digital ID?

One of the Citizen Cosmos podcast episodes is dedicated to the problem of self-sovereign identity or SSI. 
You can check out our [discussion](https://www.citizencosmos.space/cheqd) of its pros and cons with the CTO and co-founder of Cheqd Ankur Banerjee. 
In this article, however, we want to dive deeper into the topic and understand what SSI is, how we can use it, and how it is different from public and private key pairs. 





Hey Cosmonauts!

Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website. Yes... it took us longer than usual to come to this, but as they say 'Rome was not built in a day' (just for the record: it might have been, the hosts don't know this for sure).

We know, you're super curious as to why it took us that long to achieve this. And here is the 101: at first we were building our own website from scratch. Small correction: [Sergey](https://www.citizencosmos.space/hosts/sergey) was pretending to be a web designer, but that really didn't work out as planned. Joking aside, the idea with having a website built from scratch is great, though it requires a lot of initial input, design and a thorough up keeping. The latter was the trigger decision against it.

Just when we thought that all was lost, we stumbled upon Fireside and so far we really like it. The cost-quality and time-consumption overweight all the cons. The biggest con, of course, not being `100%` in charge of the content, it can be blocked, etc. For this we are planning to host some kind of a simple 'mirror' on IPFS in the (not-so near) future for the blog posts and a content menu. And, we already publish each of our episodes to IPFS, using [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/search/citizen%20cosmos).

In reality a lot more is planned in that direction, and we decided start somewhere, rather than to endlessly feature-w$$k over the future.
