#Staking as a way out.
===========================================

What's happening in the cryptocurrency market? We're in a deep bear market. Crypto is gradually decreasing. Some investors lose their patience, causing intense panic. Selling at the bottom of the market means fixing prices. Buying at the top of the market when the crypto is at its peak is by far not the most intelligent move.

The best strategy, in this case, is to buy more coins from fundamental projects such as Cosmos while the price is moderate. But what to do if you have already entered the crypto with all available funds? Learn more below.

Insider information.

Let's take a closer look at a couple of recent news:

1. According to Sam Bankman-Fried, exchanges do not have the liquidity they claim.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the [FTX cryptocurrency exchange](https://ftx.com), said that some interactions are already secretly insolvent.

Some small crypto exchanges are “quasi-insolvent.” So it was stated in an interview with Forbes by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, although he did not specify which deals he was talking about. However, he noted that some companies have "gone too far."

“There are companies that have gone too far. It's impractical to support them because of a significant breach in the corporate account, regulatory issues, and because there isn't much business left to save."



2. Coinbase announced plans for expansion in the crypto market. They already have offices in Germany and the UK, and soon there will be offices in the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, and France.


Here is the statement from [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/ru/):

“During market downturns, it can be tempting to shy away from international expansion. However, we first launched in the UK and EU during the bear market in 2015, and the move paid off when the recovery began a few years later. We will continue to expand globally and make everything possible to develop cryptoeconomics."


This news informs us that a stock market collapse is possible soon. As a result, many scam projects will close and disappear, as well as several crypto exchanges with fake liquidity.


But at the same time, the big players are planning to continue their expansion, hoping to capture market share as long as conditions are favorable.


The decline of the crypto markets may continue. Some players and market participants will not survive this fall.


At the same time, after such a substantial fall, there will be a reversal and rapid growth. The major players are preparing for this growth by opening additional European offices.

Conclusions

We have already mentioned that you should not store your coins in custodial wallets.  Considering everything described above, keeping cash on exchanges is not reasonable. A collapse may happen in the crypto market, and it would be better if you found a haven for your coins. After that, only real projects will remain afloat, and all the scam projects will cease to exist.

Strategy

You may ask, where is this quiet and safe harbor to save the coins? Of course, cold non-custodial wallets are the obvious way out. However, there is a simpler and more efficient way - [staking!](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking)


Staking using [non-custodial wallets](https://youtube.com/shorts/WLSikBfgqDc?feature=share) is the most reasonable strategy. Your coins will remain stored in your non-custodial wallet. When staking, your funds are not dead weight.


As usual, the bear market turns into a bull market rather quickly. Not everyone has time to jump into a rocket taking off. At this moment, it is essential to already be on board!


The results are simple:


- Do not sell coins at the bottom of the market. It will only bring you losses.


- Get ready for a storm that will sink the scammers and keep your coins safe.


- Securely stake coins using non-custodial staking and increase your funds.


- Prepare for a sudden high-speed take-off, and don't leave the spaceship, so the rocket doesn't take off without you.
