### Evmos&Cosmos news till July 11

- Peng Zhong stepped down as CEO a month after former company head Jae Kwon said he would lead NewTendermint, part of Ignite's split into two firms in May. During his time at the firm, many knew him for developing the first Cosmos crypto wallet, Voyager, later renamed Lunie, and helping to introduce liquid staking. The reason for the decision is yet unclear. 

- The @CosmosHub which is the home of $ATOM is evolving into the interchain provider to Cosmos, a service that no other Cosmos chain offers. 

- Injective - the blockchain built for finance on Cosmos IBC had a [mainnet chain upgrade](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/30966) last week. Smart contracts are now live! One of the first smart contracts is the CosmWasm smart contract layer which brings self-executing smart contracts, binary options, interchain accounts, and more. 

- This week has been great for $ATOM so far! With the price of $7.71 at the beginning of the week, it made a steep way up and reached $9.34 on July 8th! The inflation is slightly above 12%, and the approximate staking APR is just a bit below 19%.
