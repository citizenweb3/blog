**What is EVMOS?**

Evmos is a scalable, high-performance Proof-of-Stake blockchain fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum but built using the Cosmos SDK.

**What is it for?**

EVMOS allows you to combine Ethereum and Cosmos. Leverage the widespread adoption of the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/) and all benefits of Proof-of-stake while leveraging Cosmos. Developers can use Solidity smart contract language and take advantage of the Tendermint core consensus algorithm used in Cosmos. Moreover, they have access to all applications of the [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem) through the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol)
These features allow developers to use the existing tools and software of the Ethereum ecosystem to seamlessly deploy smart contracts that interact with the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem. The list of projects that have already been deployed or are planned to be launched in the Evmos ecosystem can be viewed here.

**Smart contracts on EVMOS**

Essentially, EVMOS enables cross-chain transactions across the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, unlocking value and creating enormous opportunities for new and existing projects. Ethereum-based developers can continue to write smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper and make them work on any IBC-compatible blockchains. The primary function of [EVMOS](https://evmos.org/), as its founder Federico Kunze Kullmer called it, is: "Port of entry from Ethereum to Cosmos." As a result, DeFi projects and applications have become even closer and more accessible to users. EVMOS is a massive step in establishing interchain interaction, which opens up new opportunities for both Ethereum and Cosmos.
