[00:01:42] Citizen Cosmos: Hi everyone! Welcome to a new episode of Citizen Cosmos! Today with me I have Ivan, the co-founder of Carbon protocol and Switcheo lad. Hi and welcome to the show! I have to be honest with you I've interviewed all sorts of projects and I haven’t recieved so many questions from the audience yet, so kudos on gathering such a great community around your project. First of all, can you please for the audience and for me introduce yourself in your own words? 

[00:02:54] Ivan: Hi and thanks for having me! I've been with Switcheo lab since the start, I was the co-founder and we've been in space for a pretty long. Most of us, however, are right now known for Carbon protocol which is a Cosmos SDK app chain, and what we're really trying to build is a decentralized future where any sort  of finance structure and inside financial action can be done on this one protocol called Carbon. The reason why we’ve started is really because we tried using Ethereum and Bitcoin and it really doesn't solve everything because like for Bitcoin you can transfer funds from on person A to person B and for Etherum it's just Ethereum, everyone's using it, it’s crowded, the fees are high and it's not cross-chain compatible. So when we started on our journey we interacted with many other blockchain protocos out there and we realized that there was this gap in the market and that's what made us build this team and after many years of experimentation and building together what what we came out with is our current flagship protocol Carbon. 

[00:04:05] Citizen Cosmos: so you said flagship product and that means there are other products. Help me to figure out the order. Switcheo, Carbon, Zilswap, Zolar. Help me put them in the right order. 

[00:04:22] Ivan: Like I said we are software development team, we have a team of over 20 
developers, software engineers designers, etc. So we put a lot of different sort of software some of them are our own babies, some of them are contracted by either party companies who are saying that they're going to give us grant to build this awesome thing on their protocol or development incetive. So that's the reason why we have multiple products but let's go to them one at a time. Let's talk about Carbon first as I think most of the comminity is excited to hear about it. So, the reason why we built it is because of an earlier product which is a DeX decentalized exchange that was on a different blockchain. At that time this exchange could only rebuilt it is because when we were exploring the various blockchain protocols we realized that there's a huge gap here, tazes don’t exist, the tokens we purchased cannot actually be liquid and we have to wait and back for people like central exchange finance to list them before we actually have that liquidity. That's when we started the journey to build DeX for different types of protocols, and pretty early on we realized that it is not going to work and that's because when you're on a single protocol, you're isolated and siloed into that blockchain and it's really not cross compatible, it's really not Binance, not FTX, you don't have a truly decently change because a truly decentralized dex change needs to support any sort of token on any side protocol. When we realized that this single isolated way of building dexes doesn't work, we decided that Cosmos SDK ecosystem is the most mature, it has the most amount of fundamental foundational code out there and we could use this technology to what we wanted which is a decentralized exchange and then it's more than just a trading venue that trades one
token for another in just one isolated silo. We wanted protocol that could trade any sort of thing not just tooken from single blockchain but across multiple blockchains and on top of that. We also wanted to support any sort of financial action that you could do in traditional finance so that will mean things like future perpetuals, options, borrowing, lending bonds, etc. So we wanted to make sure that this is actually possible in a truly decentralized fashion and that started us on our journey towards builiding Carbon and now Demex. So Demex is the second product which we call reference user interface to showcase how a protocol like Carbon could be used. Currently Demex supports the book trading, it supports liquidity pools mms and the whole set of what you expect to find in DeFi today and what we are hoping is that as we gain users in Demex eventually people will look at Carbon as a protocol for finance and build their own products on it whether it's lending and borrowing, whether it's different types of option structures or even just using the EVM sandbox within a protocol to construct their own novel financial products. I do want to mention that mentioned products are currently on Zilliqa blockchain so we are actually the leading protocol for Zilliqa so you will find any sort of DeDi application that you find on blockchain like Ethereum and most probably it's built by us. So we have built zero swap, we have a union of sub decks, we have XYLO which is a launch pad platform and we have RT
which is an NFT platform and then we have Zola. 

[00:09:09] Citizen Cosmos: Correct me if I'm wrong but the name Switcheo comes to mind nor from even two but three years ago and I heard it is from Zilliqa and Ethereum you did migrate to Cosmos after alredy started on those protocols, am I correct?

[00:09:30] Ivan: Actually we started really early on on this blockchain called NEO. We launched one of the first atomic swaps between two different protocols but because it was slow not really scalable, etc. That's why we looked outwards and we found Cosmos ecosystem and we started building on Carbom. 

[00:10:06] Citizen Cosmos: What attracted you to choose Cosmos? Was it the idea of IBC, what was the biggest attraction for you?

[00:10:12] Ivan: We examined a few protocols but definitely Cosmos was the leader by far for a few reasons. The first reason was its fundamental consensus algorithm was very rock solid that it's tendermint and it's fully in production already by Cosmos Hub. And the way that the whole SDK infrastructure was such that it's really independent. We do not need  for example the permission of Cosmos to launch our blockchain and hook up to it, and it doesn't really matter whether the other a chain succeed or fail independently, we like the idea of being permissionless in terms of building as well. So that that was definitely the first point. Second point was the structure of the whole code in terms of technology was really clean. They separated the contents layer with application that you could bootstrap things very quickly written and that really allows us to fulfill our vision. Our dream was to have sophisticated financial contracts, financial actions to be performed on the blockchain, and very early on we felt that it was impossible to do on EVM. Not literally impossible but more like not valuable because at the end of the day you're going to be fighting with the rest of the world , you’re fighting projects that are launching a token maintaining NFTs, and for us running on this independent chain natively on the on the machine of the node and having only that run gave us the confidence that eventually when we make it or when the protocol makes it, it's going to be scaled, it is not going to collapse under its own way. So that’s the second thing that was really important for us and I think the final thing was the concept of IBC. It was really enticing to us, we really believe
that that's the way for it because if everyone understands what their protocol is supposed to
do to and then you link them up in a permissionless trustless way and that is the current architecture for scalability where you have independent entities and then you talk to each other based on your own trust model based on how you want it to be structured rather than having 
a certain entity govern things and white listings. We loved the whole concept from the start. 

[00:12:52] Citizen Cosmos: Could you say that Cosmos has an architecture where you at the same time can have competition but don't have to fight for the block space because you have app specific block chains which can communicate, which still leaves the ability to compete with each other in the free market but they don't need to fight for the block space.  

[00:13:13] Ivan: Correct. You can compete, you don't waste resources, you don't waste the users’s fees, and more importantly it's still composable. The blockchain still can talk to each other which was the whole reason why we want to do but a second separate protocol we felt that we don't want to be siloed in our own blockchain that we chose. 

[00:13:34] Citizen Cosmos: I have a devil’s advocate question. You said Etherium is just Ethereum. What did you mean by that? I would love to hear a little bit more of your thoughts there. 

[00:13:44] Ivan: So I  feel the Etherium as a global consensus today is okay and at the end of the day a lot of  the assets that we use are from Ethereum. But it's probably not the correct solution for a lot of things including the financial relays that we're trying to build. So the way we do it, we custom build code that is meant to run specific way. If you’re going to do borrowing and landing, you’re not going to do two crazy things,  so we don't need a fool virtue machine for that, we just need the building blocks that represent this various states, these first actions that need to be done, whereas for  Ethereum they try to make it a Sandbox which is good and bad the good thing. The good thing is that you bootstrap this ecosystem community  and the bad side is that you’re constrained to certain limitations with the EVM and more importantly it's never going to be truly cross-compatible unlike the IBC chains where the protocol is already built in this knowledge of communication with other protocols.

[00:14:55] Citizen Cosmos: You said also for you one of the things was like a gap in the market. What specific gap are you talking about? Is it a gap of a protocol like your own which can communicate and not sile it out or was there another gap that you saw and then that’s what came up as something to fix that gap? 

[00:15:13] Ivan: Yeah so early on it was really a gap in just decentralized protocols in general but that it's lesser reason now but there are still gaps in certain areas, so what we have solved is DeFi and dexes in a single protocol, we have not solved cross-chain exchanges, we have
not solved derivatives in a scalable way, we have not solved on-chain options, we have not solved things that we're trying to built. So we have solved it on other blockchains but not on Ethereum. On Demex we can do a full on-chain central limit which means it looks exactly like
Binance and that's all running on the node itself. It is all running on the validators, there’s no  centralized backend hosting. We're trying to fill those gaps and there's still a lot more that we were going to build in the coming months and years. 

[00:14:55] Citizen Cosmos: You mentioned order books and I have a question. I have noticed lately, since a few months there is at least a couple of projects now that arise and they are creating an order book blockchain. So for projects like Carbon or Switcheo Labs or the whole ecosystem, is that the way forward to create their own big  blockchain order books? What is the way here for something like Carbon and Switcheo? Is that to create your own things like that and to connect them because IBC allows you to do that or is it the way to use sidechains which are actual order books which give the feeds to other protocols? 

[00:17:20] Ivan: Well I'm not super familiar with those projects but I do know that in terms of on-chain order books there are a couple of protocols trying to do the same thing and I think what matters is composibility and order book is just a representation of intents of various users and if an app like Demex which is the ui layer, if it’s able to display multiple protocols, and combine it together, then I think it is great for the user and I don't think that it's possible to force everyone to use a single centre of the book layer, I think that's a bit naive for various reasons but at the same time also in spirit of decentralization I don't think that some good model to go by if your protocol is providing you with order book, that's fine but because our promise was that we want to make sure that everything that needs to be done, can be done within the protocol so we have built the audible engine reading the protocol. Whether you use it or not it's a different method altogether. For example it's possible to interract with the swap, the liquidity pool modules, it’s possible to do cdps and things like that separetely from that order book. So it's
really about providing the building blocks and making sure that it's available for the developers and the users when time comes. 

[00:18:50] Citizen Cosmos: Before I jump to the community questions, I would love to hear a little bit about your background. I do know that you worked as a CTO in several companies, you worked in SAS in HR if the information is correct of course. But even before that how you heard of blockchain? You woke up one day and decided to go build the decentralized protocol? So how did you get there I would love to hear that.  

[00:19:20] Ivan: I was always a technical person so I used to be CTO for many companies, none of them were blockchain. In terms of how we got started blockchain it's really because of our technical background. We started from the technologu angle, not even from trying to build on it or even investing in it. How I first found out about blockchain was right around time of Ethereum’s ICO, so of course I've heard of Bitcoin and things like that but I never really touched
it but what really got me interested was ICO because they shielded it really well, the called it the world computer. So as a tech guy I thought this was a really good idea so I went in to look more into it. It looked pretty interesting I didn't really understand it fully at the time but I was interested so I wanted to try some, they had the language, they had solidity. So I wanted to try a new language.  But they say that to actually try it on production right in there you need some Ether and the thing was that ICO had already closed and it was in this time when I just missed the guys and then they were just doing the main thing. So I thought I’d check on it in two months. Funny story, two months later it really appeared on hacker news and I really found it two days right after they launched them in there. But the thing was when I went back it was time to play this new cool technology. They said that to get Ether you need to go into Coinbase website and buy the coin and swap it. I was confused and thought it was a scam, and just like a year later my teammate was looking at me on one of the companies that I was CTO of and he asked me if I knew the thing called Ether and that it went 1000 last week. So that’t when I decided to really look into this. We invested time into looking at this whole technology stack and we also looked at new protocols like Neo and found these gaps. The rest is history. 

[00:21:54] Citizen Cosmos: Obviously, your internal drive there was to improve their experience. In my opinion it was more of a professional drive. Did you connect at all to the philosophy of blockchain and decentralization or was that later already?

[00:22:25] Ivan: Definitely we started from a technology angle but we connected really early on in part due to our frustration about tokens and things like that and also in part due to fundamental premise that you should be able to control your wealth, where you want to spend your money and that's the reason why I’ve never actually worked for anyone for very long because I like to control my destiny, future and the way I use my money is very fundamental to me so definitely there was one of the huge things that made us go into it and stick with it. 

[00:23:14] Citizen Cosmos: I can totally relate to every word you said. Let’s continue with some general questions. You did already answer what other dapps your team is working on. Are there any teams apart from Switcheo Labs or Carbon protocol which are currently sponsored either by grants or community pools that are working on other dapps and protocol in the ecosystem?

[00:24:56] Ivan: Not direct. So two things. One is dapp that is meant to be a competitor to 1inch that’s a multi-chain and that's still quite in the early works so I can't say too much into it but definitely that the Demex would not be the only sort of application that they run on Carbon. And the other thing is they are teams that are working on dapps for Carbon but not directly user phasing. So liquidity enhancement, liquidity bridging ,things like that. Our main focus now for
the protocol is getting the liquidity so that's why a lot of the the projects that we’re trying to bootstrap trying to grow right now very are very liquidity focused more than like application focus.

[00:25:45] Citizen Cosmos: Ok, second one. What are you most excited about going forward? 

[00:25:48] Ivan: There's just so many. We're going to launch a new sort of financial product. We already have data features, we're going to go with perpetuals. What excites me the most would probably be the money market and CPD module that we have recently added to the roadmap. So we haven't really talked much about it, I think we haven't even published the article, hopefully the team may not be too upset. But anyway I’m going to front run them. So we’re going to build a money market for the Cosmos ecosystem and the idea here is that there would be a borrowing and landing market for all Cosmos app chains so you can characterize Osmo and borrow at them for example or even USDC and then use this to trade. More importantly, this whole multi-collateral money market we also are looking at introducing a stable coin. I know there's a couple of stable coins coming out for the Cosmos ecosystem, but we are hoping that our version of it will be the most useful for users for two reasons. One is because of the the way we're going to build this, we're going to build it the way you can use many types of Cosmos app chain tokens at once to pack this minting of the stable coin and on top of that this stable coin can be used on dex futures and perpetual markets so this is like a USD token that you can actually trade, you can long and short Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

[00:27:38] Citizen Cosmos: I have one suggestion for you. Don't hire doc one if you're going to plan to do a stable coin. Going forward, outside of Switcheo and Carbon and apply it to your  decentralized opinions in the way you see the web3 going forward. Is there anything like technology that you're really excited about in the web3 space?  

[00:25:48] Ivan: I really want to be able to not use banks anymore. I think that's what will really excite me and I think we're getting there but we’re so close and yet so far. The upcoming merge of Ethereum that they’re going to proof of stake that’s a huge one, in my opinion it's the next step to making it mass market enough because the proof of work system just didn't work right and in terms of fundamental concensus layer the next step will be getting on this layer to interoperate properly. Now there's too many layer tools. What I really want to see is for all of them to interconnect, all of them to be liquid with each other and of course I really implement some sort of intel blockchain standard. So implement IBC and then we have this whole decentralized network of protocols flowing around without anyone stopping there and then at the point you really don't need banks. The funny thing is that I didn't use to have this annoyance with them. Only after I made money I got more annoyed because it’s just terrible. 

[00:29:30] Citizen Cosmos: I totally understand what you mean. What do you think is the biggest thing that’s stopping the world realizing that the evil is not the rich people or the poor people, the evil is the middle man that stands in the middle and tries to put one against the other? 

[00:29:55] Ivan: I think it's pretty hard to convince people in that manner. I think for the crypto community, for us what we will need to focus on is making it better than the alternative. So the example I love to give is the cable companies charge ridiculous amounts for packages. They package a bunch of stuff and then you need one of them and you pay a shitload of money. So the priority came along and then they started losing share because people started moving towards that but the thing wasn't that it was not really about the fees or anything and the reason
why you know that is because Netflix came along, everyone started stop pirating, everyone just
signed up on Netflix because it gives you better user experience. That's the thing we actually need to do, we need to give users a better experience than the banks. It will be very hard to
convince people otherwise. So for us in the crypto space we really need to work on user experience and getting people to onboard easily if we actually want the masses to figure out the better alternitive. So things I like to point out are always application safety, how they make
sure that users know on a correct front-end, how do you actually protect the user by improving the wallets, check contract addressers, they can get the transactions for you, etc.  

[00:31:43] Citizen Cosmos: Could you summarize your words that it's not about convincing users, it's about giving them adoption, it's about bringing that industry to a point where users don't need to be overhelmed with the amount of switches, right? 

[00:32:06] Ivan: It's not about convincing them about something, it is just showing them that there's a better alternative and that's what we need to focus on. 

[00:32:14] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting that that you say that it's not about convincing because in the last ten years or even a little bit more that I've been around blockchain one thing that I came to realize it’s very difficult for people who never heard about it and then what I realized is that you don't need to talk about blockchain to people to show the benefits of blockchain, you need to explain to them how the current system works and then they ask what to do with it and how to change it. So what you say has a similar direction. The next questions are going to be a bit combined because they are a little bit similar. Where do you see Carbon and the other products that you're working on in the next three to five years? You kind of answer that already but do you see any specific apart from more adoption, do you see anything else that you think will happen the next three five years for those protocols that you're building?

[00:34:06] Ivan: Our hope is that it will be an equivalent alternative to what users use today whether it's options or FTX features or Binance for the spot markets. I think that’s the level we want to achieve and I do strongly believe that we can get to the level and of course the thing about crypto is that it's independent, there's a lot of what could be done in terms of our outreach terms of getting people to to know about these alternatives and that's something we’re working really hard towards and want to achieve that angle. 

[00:34:49] Citizen Cosmos: Is Demex token is something you consider?

[00:35:08] Ivan: It's definitely something that we have been thinking about but we don't launch tokens non-stop even though we have so many projects. We have only one Carbon token, and the reason that we don't like to do tokens for the sake of tokens. However it's something we’re considering because we do want to ensure that each entity is decentralized and has its own governance and community that can run itself. We want it to work even without central labs. So for that to happen eventually that's probably a necessary thing. So what I mean here is that we see Carbon as the base protocol layer, something like Etherium. And Demex would be something like uniswap, so it makes sense for application to have a token for various things. So one of the things is that we’re trying to solve and that came out recently are Tornado cash sanctions and things like that. Who is going to host the UI, what if Cederic cannot host  and therefore can we use a token to incetivize a decentralized hosting of the UI that anyone can assess in a censorship resistance in a permissionless manner. So that's one the first use cases of how do we incentivize. And the other thing is also in terms of governing. What should be displayed, what should be accepted on the UI governing things like incentive programs. So the other things are incentives. I think it would be good to have to have each application have its own incentive mechanisms for users if you use Demex as opposed to another application on Carbon you should understand how the Demex works. So it goes back to the to the same mechanic that DeFi uses. The users are your owners and the way to do that is to have it Demex token. 

[00:37:10] Citizen Cosmos: You mentioned that you would consider ownership or governance tokens for every single protocol to make it more decentralized. Would you be considering airdrops to Atom communities or Osmosis to raise awareness?

[00:37:48] Ivan: Yeah I think definitely that's that's one of the main initial distribution methods that we consider and again it was in my point just now where one of the main reasons for having a new token of Demex token to incentivize to try to use this to the application. So it
does make sense to that sort of model. 

[00:38:08] Citizen Cosmos: Would Atom be considered as a possibility for the time when the perpetual markets will be launched?

[00:38:16] Ivan: Yeah definitely. I think one of the main things that we want to do at the start is to have perpetual markets for a lot of the Cosmos tokens because I feel right now that's not many venues where you can actually do that and since we are within the Cosmos ecosystem we want to start with supporting the applications within the ecosystem. 

[00:38:39] Citizen Cosmos: How is the progress of the CDP going? 

[00:38:42] Ivan: My team is going to kill me but I want to launch it by the end of the year. 

[00:38:52] Citizen Cosmos: How are you planning to increase the volume of Demex? Currently the volume isn't very high. Are there any plans that you have to increase that and how?

[00:39:24] Ivan: I think for volume the first thing is liquidity and that's why I mentioned just now we're working on multiple liquidity programs at the same time, some of them are already really close, they’re really in place or just that the amount is small. We are trying to make sure that we improve the reliability and the security of these programs first. And after that we have a large range of liquidity. So first step is liquidity. You can ask how we get volume down. We do have plans for this stage. Demex can be used as an incentive for users to try out Demex. Second things is in terms of the traditional campaigns that central exchanges run. We can do it as a DAO and come up with regular competition schemes, refferal schemes, etc.

[00:41:03] Citizen Cosmos: Thank you for the answering the bunch of questions, that was a bombardment. I have two more questions. On the Switcheo website it says “enabling a world where trust is optional”. So do you really believe that we can come today as we are today's humanity, society to a world where we don't need trust? Is that really possible?

[00:41:44] Ivan: I think in a lot of ways it's possible. Right now it's not just trust it’s also reliance and probably that's the key idea we're going for. There's a lot of reliance on this trust that doesn't need to be there, and because of this reliance people abuse the trust that you give them and then it's really the main trust of this statement: can we remove this reliance on trust where you can still trust people by is optional. 

[00:42:13] Citizen Cosmos: I really hope that we get to that stage while we are still young. I guess you are more optimistic about the way it is but it's good. On that note to resume all that and considering you're building this huge ecosystem which is multichain, what keeps you motivated in your daily life? 

[00:42:58] Ivan: I think I do have a lot of things going for me, first of all I love what I do, I love building in general, I love technology, I love looking at these crazy new ideas that everyone comes up with now and then sometimes the bad ideas and then we all have arguments over why USDt doesn't work and things like that. But in general I really love what I do, so that's the first thing. So I don't do it for the sake of money. The second thing is the team and the vision. So I have gathered a team that's really great to work with and that's something that keeps me motivated to get to the office.

[00:44:13] Citizen Cosmos: Love it, man, that was a good answer! Thank you very much for your time!
