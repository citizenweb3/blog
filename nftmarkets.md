### NFT Markets

Following up on [the 64th Citizen Cosmos podcast with CO (Community Overlord) from Orbital Apes](https://www.citizencosmos.space/orbitalapes), we will give you a brief overview of the leading, most influential, and trending NFT marketplaces. We talked to CO about Orbital Apes' unique path, NFT product and marketplace, and the play-to-earn game. If you haven’t seen this episode, check it out right away! Now it’s time to explore which other marketplaces there are, what makes them unique and how they influence the crypto industry. 

Being a relatively new trend, NFTs have exploded into the crypto market, becoming one of the most bought and sold assets. Today, there are multiple marketplaces - decentralized platforms that allow users to create, buy, sell and store non-fungible tokens, and each has its features and flaws. But it all started in 2017 with Dapper Labs' Cryptokitties project, which offered the first potential mass adoption of NFTs. Since then, the NFT market has reached incredible proportions in just four years. Rarible, SuperRare, OpenSea, and many others have emerged. 

The NFT marketplaces can be classified into two categories: complex and specialized. Complex marketplaces provide the ability to trade any NFT. You can create your own NFTs and put them up for sale, regardless of what objects are tokenized. An example of a complex marketplace is OpenSea. Specialized marketplaces focus on trading certain types of NFTs, such as digital art or project-specific in-game NFTs. For example, the Valuables NFT marketplace allows users to buy and sell tweets. Axie Infinity is a specialized playground for gaming items and an NFT-based online game developed by Sky Mavis. Orbital Apes can also be regarded as a specialized marketplace as they mainly focus on their digital art and soon-to-be-released play-to-earn game. 

Another way to distinguish marketplaces is by their accessibility. Some are completely open, some are curated, and some are proprietary. 

Open marketplaces work like eBay. They do not restrict users from creating NFTs and putting them up for sale. There is also no need to submit an application and go through the verification procedure. The user can simply connect the wallet and start issuing their own NFT. Owners of existing NFTs can put their tokens up for secondary sale. One of the most popular and open markets is OpenSea. It is the oldest and largest NFT trading platform in terms of trading volume, which supports the trading of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens, which have been used to create more than 4 million unique digital items. OpenSea allows users to list NFTs not built on the platform itself. It is also possible to automatically record NFTs released on platforms integrated with OpenSea. 

Curated platforms decide which NFTs can be removed, listed, and traded and are more exclusive. Applying on the platform is a way to resist scams and maintain a high quality of work. The most popular curated marketplaces include Super Rare, Foundation, Makers Place, and Nifty Gateway. For example, the Foundation marketplace is run by users who invite other NFT creators to the platform. Users can also join the official marketplace Discord group and share their projects. The invitation option becomes available to the user after the first sale of his NFT. 

The proprietary marketplaces offer NFTs created by their operators only and do not allow the sale or display of other non-fungible tokens. They are exclusive, rare, expensive, and in high demand. Some marketplaces include "showcases" where users can showcase their NFT collections online. For example, OpenSea also allows users to display their collectibles. One of the most popular proprietary marketplaces is Bored Ape Yacht Club. It belongs to the NFT/PFP category. PFP or Picture for Proof is a type of NFT used as profile pictures and was one of the first marketplaces to use this consensus. It is a collection of 10,000  “bored monkeys" images with a random combination of accessories. Each NFT is a club card that gives its owners access to exclusive merch and bonuses. Direct sales on the platform are completed, but the secondary sales are still available on OpeanSea. 

Overall, the NFT market is changing daily, and news marketplaces emerge all the time, changing how we interact with NFTs. We at Citizen Cosmos are closely looking at all market changes and will keep providing you with the latest information!
