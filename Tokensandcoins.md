**Tokens and coins**
======================================================

Everyone can create their currency.

The main question, however,  is how will this money be provided? Thanks to blockchain and smart contracts, we can create our values. One might question themselves, what makes these digital values so valuable?
After the emergence of the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/), which allowed the creation of tokens, two sides appeared:

Tokens and coins.

And sometimes, they get confused.

To make it easier to explain, let's give two definitions.

The internal blockchain coin is used to pay for gas.

The tokens are issued on the blockchain.
They also have their blockchain, but the difference is that we pay gas for a token transaction in coins.
In other words, coins have their blockchain, and tokens are issued on the blockchain.

**A coin can also be a token**
----------------------------
For example, bitcoin is a coin, it has its blockchain, Bitcoin,
and within this blockchain, the commission for all transactions is paid by bitcoin.
But thanks to various bridges, we can send Bitcoin to the Ethereum network, and there it will become wBitcoin (wrapped). So now, it is no longer a coin but a token on the Ethereum network. To send it, the commission must be paid in ETH. That is the Ethereum platform, in which the ETH coin made it possible to create tokens on the Ethereum platform. To be able to send them, you need to pay a commission in ETH currencies.

**Even more interesting is the Binance coin.**

There is a native Binance network, the BNB coin. In addition, there is a [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain), wBNB(wrapped) - coin. Since payment for gas in the BSC network is in wBNB currencies, the coin remains a coin during a transaction from the native Binance network to the BSC network. In addition, Binance native network has a token - BUSD. And when sending BUSD from the native network to BSC, the token remains a token.

**It's easy to get confused. Let's use examples.**

The advent of 3rd generation blockchains increasingly removes the difference between token and coin. Thanks to the IBC module, we can send coins from one network to another. They become tokens in some networks but do not cease to be coins in their network. 

**For example, in the [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network/), there is an ATOM coin.**

The ATOM coin pays all transactions on the network. But we can send the ATOM coin to the Persistence network. Inside this network, ATOM will not be a coin but a token. Because the Persistence network has an XPRT coin, all transactions are paid. If we want to send an ATOM back to the Cosmos Network, we must pay a fee to XPRT. If I send an XPRT coin to the Cosmos Network, it becomes a token on that network. To pay for transactions in the Cosmos Network, I must use the ATOM coin.

**There is also an [Osmosis network](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=ATOM&to=OSMO).**

There is an OSMO coin in this network. Therefore, all transactions are carried out by using the OSMO coin. Also, this network has an ION token, but it is not used as a fee payment. If we send OSMO from the Osmosis network to the Cosmos Network, we first pay for the transaction with an OSMO coin. OSMO will become a token in the Cosmos Network. Likewise, with the ION token, payment for gas is in OSMO. But the ION token on the Osmosis network will also be the token on the Cosmos Network. If we send the token OSMO from the Cosmos Network to the Osmosis network, we pay for the transaction using the ATOM coin. And token will become a coin as soon as it is on the Osmosis network. But the ION token will remain a token anyway.

**Where does the value of tokens and coins come from?**

Coins represent the value of the network. Miners and validators receive coins to provide network security.

The value of tokens lies in the fact that the obligations for these tokens are fulfilled. For example, if a token is an alternative to a coin, then the value is that I can exchange this token for a coin. If for this token, I have to get some kind of service, then its value is that I can always exchange a token for a service.

**Another great example is a subway card.**

The card is a token for passage in the subway. It's valuable because I can get on the subway. If this card doesn't let me into the subway, its value is 0.

Everyone can create tokens and promise to perform some kind of service for these tokens. By doing this, someone will give value to the tokens.

**For example, you can issue a token for video shooting services.**

>*"I have issued 100 tokens, and each token equals 1 hour of my work".*

If you fulfill your duties, the token equals 1 hour of your work. But there are many operators, and if the shooting of one operator differs from another, you can create a market of tokens for shooting video. Video shooting can be equated with video editing. Therefore, we can trade tokens for the shooting and editing of videos. Depending on supply and demand, they will cost more or less relative to each other.

Based on this, the value of coins lies in the value of the network, its functionality, and the importance of tokens in the performance of services.

**PS**

But this is all super subjective and at the end of the day its not what matters.
Therefore, do not be afraid to create your digital values. The main thing is to remember to fulfill obligations.
