#### Microtick guide

Dear Cosmonauts, while recording a new episode of the podcast with Mark Jackson (the founder of Microtick), we have found out that, unfortunately,
the Microtick network will be halted on the 1st of August. After this, the project will be named DiscoveryDEX and will be moved to L2 Blockchain (probably ETH). 
Therefore, all TICK holders are to claim their tokens for the future DiscoveryDEX token. We have prepared a simple guide for you, both video and text version. 
More detailed information you can find out in our [episode](https://www.citizencosmos.space/).

> Step 1

Please go to [frontier](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/). Open Assets and find the TICK token.

> Step 7

Push “Validators” in the left menu and find - the DiscoveryDEX validator. The owner of this Validator is the DAO team.

> Step 8

Push on the Validator, and you must stake your tokens to this validator. If you previously staked with Bro n Bro or any other validator, you must redelegate your tokens.

> Step 9

Enter all amounts by clicking “Max” (but leave a minimal amount for commission) 

[![8.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/C1Vdw1Mm/8.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/McdzDzQQ)

> Step 10

The most crucial part is that in the Keplr window, you need to approve the transaction, but YOU NEED TO WRITE IN MEMO FIELD YOUR ETH ADDRESS. 

[![8.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/C1Vdw1Mm/8.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/McdzDzQQ)

> Step 11

You can check your transaction by clicking [here](https://explorer.microtick.zone/). 

[![8.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/C1Vdw1Mm/8.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/McdzDzQQ)

> Step 12

Suppose you have forgotten to write an ETH address in the MEMO field. Don’t worry. You can do it again. 
For this you need just to send 0.000001  amount of the TICK to following address: 
micro1ee05vm4kw8yp2avx8gpxegynpytl5g5hfrexhm  (autodelegation for DiscoveryDEX val) with the following MEMO : 9AFABB473............

> Step 13

The most crucial part is that in the Keplr window, you need to approve the transaction, but YOU NEED TO WRITE IN MEMO FIELD YOUR ETH ADDRESS. 

[![8.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/C1Vdw1Mm/8.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/McdzDzQQ)

> Step 11

In explorer, please check the amount, validator, and memo. (Выделить МЕМО)

For this you need just to send 0.000001  amount of the TICK to following address: 
micro1ee05vm4kw8yp2avx8gpxegynpytl5g5hfrexhm  (autodelegation for DiscoveryDEX val) with the following MEMO : 9AFABB473............
