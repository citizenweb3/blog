**Evmos weekly Digest**
===========================

- Evmos is now supported in [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) (V0.31.0) extension wallet for DeFi users created by DeBank, the leading DeFi portfolio tracker that supports many DeFi protocols across more than 30 chains. The revocation function is already built into a wallet! 

- The past week has been rich in updates and introductions into the ecosystem! Another project thatâ€™s been launched on Evmos is the [Cosmostation Extension Wallet](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/cosmos). It supports 40+ sovereign Cosmos networks, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible L1s and L2s!
