###  Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website 

Hey Cosmonauts!

Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website. Yes... it took us longer than usual to come to this, but as they say 'Rome was not built in a day' (just for the record: it might have been, the hosts don't know this for sure).

We know, you're super curious as to why it took us that long to achieve this. And here is the 101: at first we were building our own website from scratch. Small correction: [Sergey](https://www.citizencosmos.space/hosts/sergey) was pretending to be a web designer, but that really didn't work out as planned. Joking aside, the idea with having a website built from scratch is great, though it requires a lot of initial input, design and a thorough up keeping. The latter was the trigger decision against it.

Just when we thought that all was lost, we stumbled upon Fireside and so far we really like it. The cost-quality and time-consumption overweight all the cons. The biggest con, of course, not being `100%` in charge of the content, it can be blocked, etc. For this we are planning to host some kind of a simple 'mirror' on IPFS in the (not-so near) future for the blog posts and a content menu. And, we already publish each of our episodes to IPFS, using [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/search/citizen%20cosmos).

In reality a lot more is planned in that direction, and we decided start somewhere, rather than to endlessly feature-w$$k over the future.

Feedback and comments are most welcome! The best place to leave comments is [here](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Citizen-Cosmos/issues/17). If the issue is already closed, feel free to open a new one. We like issues.

### Citizen Cosmos is taking over the fuckgoolge validator on the Cosmos hub and launching a brand

Dear Citizens of Cosmos,

Citizen Cosmos is pleased to announce the taking over and the rebranding of the 'fuckgoogle' Cosmos hub validator into the Citizen Cosmos validator! In [a recent post](https://cybercongress.ai/fuckgoogle-validator/) the team of the 'fuckgoogle' validator announced the start of the migration process. We would like to confirm this from our side.

What will happen and what can be expected?

Recently the validator got a delegation of 425,000 ATOMs from the Tendermint team. After talks with Tendermint, they have agreed to upkeep the delegation in the light of recognizing the work that Citizen Cosmos does for the Cosmos hub.

This work includes:
- The Citizen Cosmos podcast
- Managing of the [@cosmos_rus](https://twitter.com/cosmos_rus) Twitter page
- Managing the [Cosmos Moscow meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Cosmos-Moscow) (so far we helped to organize and manage 2 educational events)
- Managing the [RU-based Cosmos news channel](https://t.me/cosmosinrussian) on Telegram
- Ongoing help with translating and spreading the RU version of Today in Cosmos [(@cosmos_rus)](https://twitter.com/cosmos_rus)
- Active involvement in the community of Cosmos

What can be expected:
A complete rebranding of the validator after the migration process is finished. Sergey has already launched another validator on the Cyber network, which will also undergo a rebranding to the Citizen Cosmos brand, and in the future might act as a relayer bridge between the 2 networks, once IBC is up.

We have a lot of plans for the validator, specifically in the light of the work we are prepared to do within Cosmos hub and are pleased that things have turned out this way. The journey won't be easy, but we will defiantly get there and have a lot planned! 

Please keep up with our announcements, as we hope to publish the roadmap, for the newly created Citizen Cosmos brand in the next few weeks.

May the code be with us =)

### New team members onboard Citizen Cosmos 

The branding of Citizen Cosmos that [was announced a few weeks ago](https://www.citizencosmos.space/articles/validator-and-brand), has been gradually progressing. The branding included the revamping of the Citizen Cosmos podcast into a web3 brand. With the kick-off of its own [validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and the re-organization the public work we do with Cosmos Moscow, public docs, etc.

This included migrations, infrastructure set up, planning of tasks and, of course expanding the Citizen Cosmos greater team. Without any more ado... We are proud to share with the public, that our team has doubled and 2 more people have joined our team.

[@mrlp4](https://github.com/mrlp4) is helping us as a DevOps and [@nj](https://github.com/johnniecosmos) is the Citizen Cosmos community advocate. We are over the moon with these updates and are very excited to carry on building the community around Citizen Cosmos.
