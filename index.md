###  Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website 

Hey Cosmonauts!

Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website. Yes... it took us longer than usual to come to this, but as they say 'Rome was not built in a day' (just for the record: it might have been, the hosts don't know this for sure).

We know, you're super curious as to why it took us that long to achieve this. And here is the 101: at first we were building our own website from scratch. Small correction: [Sergey](https://www.citizencosmos.space/hosts/sergey) was pretending to be a web designer, but that really didn't work out as planned. Joking aside, the idea with having a website built from scratch is great, though it requires a lot of initial input, design and a thorough up keeping. The latter was the trigger decision against it.

Just when we thought that all was lost, we stumbled upon Fireside and so far we really like it. The cost-quality and time-consumption overweight all the cons. The biggest con, of course, not being `100%` in charge of the content, it can be blocked, etc. For this we are planning to host some kind of a simple 'mirror' on IPFS in the (not-so near) future for the blog posts and a content menu. And, we already publish each of our episodes to IPFS, using [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/search/citizen%20cosmos).

In reality a lot more is planned in that direction, and we decided start somewhere, rather than to endlessly feature-w$$k over the future.

Feedback and comments are most welcome! The best place to leave comments is [here](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Citizen-Cosmos/issues/17). If the issue is already closed, feel free to open a new one. We like issues.

### Citizen Cosmos is taking over the fuckgoolge validator on the Cosmos hub and launching a brand

Dear Citizens of Cosmos,

Citizen Cosmos is pleased to announce the taking over and the rebranding of the 'fuckgoogle' Cosmos hub validator into the Citizen Cosmos validator! In [a recent post](https://cybercongress.ai/fuckgoogle-validator/) the team of the 'fuckgoogle' validator announced the start of the migration process. We would like to confirm this from our side.

What will happen and what can be expected?

Recently the validator got a delegation of 425,000 ATOMs from the Tendermint team. After talks with Tendermint, they have agreed to upkeep the delegation in the light of recognizing the work that Citizen Cosmos does for the Cosmos hub.

This work includes:
- The Citizen Cosmos podcast
- Managing of the [@cosmos_rus](https://twitter.com/cosmos_rus) Twitter page
- Managing the [Cosmos Moscow meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Cosmos-Moscow) (so far we helped to organize and manage 2 educational events)
- Managing the [RU-based Cosmos news channel](https://t.me/cosmosinrussian) on Telegram
- Ongoing help with translating and spreading the RU version of Today in Cosmos [(@cosmos_rus)](https://twitter.com/cosmos_rus)
- Active involvement in the community of Cosmos

What can be expected:
A complete rebranding of the validator after the migration process is finished. Sergey has already launched another validator on the Cyber network, which will also undergo a rebranding to the Citizen Cosmos brand, and in the future might act as a relayer bridge between the 2 networks, once IBC is up.

We have a lot of plans for the validator, specifically in the light of the work we are prepared to do within Cosmos hub and are pleased that things have turned out this way. The journey won't be easy, but we will defiantly get there and have a lot planned! 

Please keep up with our announcements, as we hope to publish the roadmap, for the newly created Citizen Cosmos brand in the next few weeks.

May the code be with us =)

### New team members onboard Citizen Cosmos 

The branding of Citizen Cosmos that [was announced a few weeks ago](https://www.citizencosmos.space/articles/validator-and-brand), has been gradually progressing. The branding included the revamping of the Citizen Cosmos podcast into a web3 brand. With the kick-off of its own [validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and the re-organization the public work we do with Cosmos Moscow, public docs, etc.

This included migrations, infrastructure set up, planning of tasks and, of course expanding the Citizen Cosmos greater team. Without any more ado... We are proud to share with the public, that our team has doubled and 2 more people have joined our team.

[@mrlp4](https://github.com/mrlp4) is helping us as a DevOps and [@nj](https://github.com/johnniecosmos) is the Citizen Cosmos community advocate. We are over the moon with these updates and are very excited to carry on building the community around Citizen Cosmos. 

### Ecosystem comparison: Cosmos VS Polkadot ep.I

### Evmos: rule ‘em all

##### What is Evmos?

Evmos, short for “EVM-on-Cosmos,” will allow Ethereum contracts to communicate with the Cosmos ecosystem. From the creators of the protocol:

> Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum.

Evmos is a sovereign blockchain built with the help of the ‘Cosmos / Tendermitn’ stack, which means it has the superpowers of IBC, the communication protocol allowing all connected to it, Cosmos chains to exchange data, contracts, tokens or in ither words - communicate. 

Apart from that Cosmos-SDK is a super powerful building tool, allowing to, already today, to launch blockchains with their own DEX’s, AMM’s and many other useful modules built by first class developers around the Cosmos ecosystem.

To put all this into a different perspective - Evmos is set to become somewhat of a communication zone (let's use the already existing analogy in the Cosmos community - port) between 2 of the biggest ecosystems in the crypto world - Ethereum and Cosmos.  

##### Why did the creators of Evmos choose Cosmos?

Cosmos, which bills itself as the internet of blockchains, is a decentralized network of independent yet interoperable blockchains that are able to exchange information and tokens between each other permissionlessly.

Cosmos aims to address some of the issues faced by other blockchains — such as scalability, usability and governance — by providing the tools to help developers quickly build independent blockchains for a variety of use cases and enabling blockchains in the network to communicate with each other.

Blockchains such as Bitcoin traditionally exist as if in silos and are unable to communicate or interact with each other. Older blockchains also tend to be difficult to build on and can handle only a few transactions per second. On the other hand, Cosmos enables independent blockchains to exchange information and tokens with each other.

But, otherwise, Cosmos does have some weak sides, such as:
- It's not such a widely used [smart contract](https://forkast.news/what-are-smart-contracts-what-are-they-used-for/) platform, like Ethereum
- It’s yet to prove itself as a fully functioning, DeFi ecosystem

##### Why did the creators of Evmos choose Ethereum to bridge to?

Ethereum is a blockchain for apps and the core of the existing DeFi ecosystem in crypto. It's a network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. It is also, probably, the biggest source of innovation and R&D in the crypto world.

Ethereum offers an extremely flexible platform on top of which one can build decentralized applications using the native Solidity scripting language and Ethereum’s Virtual Machine. Dapp developers that deploy smart contracts on Ethereum benefit from a rich ecosystem of developer tooling and established best practices that have come with the maturity of the protocol.

In practice, it means that everyone can deploy apps on Ethereum. Around 70% of all TVL is secured by the Ethereum ecosystem, its total domination.
But, it also carries such risks, as:
- Usually high load of the network (L1)
- High comissions (L1)
- Slower TX finality then maybe required for certain economic tools

##### How will I benefit from a combination of Cosmos and Ethereum?

- A combination of the 2, means a full interoperable system, that has a benefit for the end user that needs to transfer their fund without a middleman (such as a CEX)
-Ethereum users gain access to a variety of new services (and a whole new ecosystem) that doesn`t require such high fees
- And if you are a Cosmos fan, you will gain to over 1400+ dApps that were are already on Ethereum 

Both Cosmos and Ethereum are provably functioning L1 ecosystems, however Evmos can provide wider features, due to its combination of 2 blockchain ecosystems. 

*Imagine having a double citizenship, but rather than biengd doble taxed and robbed by both nations, you are actually benefiting from the services, tools and products that both offer as a passport holder of both.*

#### Evmos key features and developer use cases

Let's list the key features of Evmos, that were implemented thanks to the might of Cosmos:
- High throughput via [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). Implementing Tendermint Core's Application Blockchain Interface ([ABCI](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/)) to manage the blockchain
- Leveraging [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/building-modules/intro.html) and other mechanisms implemented by the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/)
- Utilizing [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as a library to avoid code reuse and improve maintainability
- Horizontal scalability via [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc)
- Fast transaction finality

And, of course, the might of Ethereum:
- EVM compatibility
- Exposing a fully compatible Web3 [JSON-RPC](https://evmos.dev/basic/json_rpc.html) layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling ([Metamask](https://evmos.dev/guides/keys-wallets/metamask.html), [Remix](https://evmos.dev/guides/tools/remix.html), [Truffle](https://evmos.dev/guides/tools/truffle.html), etc)
- Access to the global DeFi ecosystem and a great variety of battle tested dapps

The Cosmos vision of being a network of blockchains is achieved thanks to the use of open source tools, such as, the Tendermint consensus engine and a BFT consensus algorithm, Cosmos software development kit, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, which is like the TCP/IP for blockchains, allowing blockchains to connect to each other and exchange data and value.

*When we combine it with Ethereum’s "Global computer and ecosystem for apps" we get the benefits of both worlds and minimize the disadvantages of each other.*

##### Use cases for developers

- The Evmos blockchain provides Ethereum developers to deploy their smart contracts to the Evmos EVM and get the benefits of a fast-finality Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain. Developers will also benefit from highly-reliable testnet clients that can be used to test and deploy their contracts
- Evmos will offer built-in interoperability functionalities with other Cosmos and BFT chains by using [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc). Developers can also benefit from using a bridge network to enable interoperability between mainnet Ethereum and Evmos. Either option above will allow for fast finality, using a PoS / BFT consensus engine.

##### Resume

As of today, the blockchain world is still living in the reality of separate silos that can benefit a lot from being able to communicate one to another. In a world where UX is going towards minimalism, we need to start expreminting and making blockchains a more efficient and a friendlier place to exist and to work in. By connecting such strong, independent silos, we start to minimize UX for future usage, starting from a point of real usability (working blockchains), thus allowing for a future stronger, minimalistic UX where one can fully operate with different types of values and gain the benefit of both.

Evmos helps to exchange value between the two main blockchain ecosystems ETH & Cosmos. For the end user this means the ability to benefit from both worlds and even solve certain security issues alng the way.

When we can have such a powerfull computing platform, such as Ethereum on one hand, and Cosmos with it’s scalability and cross chain communication powers, on the other - we gainn nearly limitless possibilities for applications and reduce the cost of transactions between the 2 networks.

We believe that blockchain has a future of interchain projects. Very soon we will see the benefits of collaboration between these ecosystems, which together occupy 90% of the DeFi market.
