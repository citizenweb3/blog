### [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/). Hackatom VII 2022: Challanges Overview. 

As [Hackatom VII 2022](https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022) comes in less than a month in Seoul, we at Citizen Cosmos decided to give you overview of this event. Before the event starts on July 26th, we’ll do occasional reviews related to Hackatom. Today, let’s talk about what we should expect during the event. 

HackAtom VII precede the [BUILD ASIA event](https://twitter.com/buidl_asia) and will host South Korea's best hackers. Teams will compete for a diverse range of prizes, rewarded to the best teams that build the Interchain vision aside from the hackathon. There will also be a series of free educational workshops throughout the event. 

There are three main challenges that participants will have to take part in to get the main prize. The first one is called Interchain Prize: Interoperability. The mission is to build anything that would push IBC forward. The event organizers confirm that this could be an application that leverages IBC in a novel way, a new IBC application-level packet type, improvements or modifications to lower levels of IBC, or implementation in new environments. The competitors should demonstrate their skills and talents to show how interoperability unlocks ingenuity.

The second challenge is the Hub Prize: Interchain Security. Its mission is to spin a Consumer Chain that showcases the power of the Cross Chain Validation (CCV) protocol and experiment with the application layer. The developers are encouraged to play with Interchain Security and innovate on the application layer. The task is open-ended, and the participants should show their creativity in how Interchain Security will reimagine the Cosmos-SDK chain and how the Cosmos Hub can evolve as a chain for application development and deployment. The main requirement of the challenge is to leverage Interchain security design in the project. 

The third general challenge is the Application Prize: Cosmos-SDK. The task here is to build either a blockchain with the Cosmos SDK, a rewrite of an existing module, or a tool that improves the user experience of developing with the SDK. The organizers are mainly curious about determining how well contestants work with SDK. The requirement is to use the Cosmos SDK repository or a codebase like Atlas, Lens, or any other tool that provides UX improvements to SDK.
