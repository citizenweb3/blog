### Hackatom VI 2021 overview

As [Hackatom VII 2022](https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022) comes in just a month in Seoul, we at Citizen Cosmos decided to give you a weekly overview of this event. Each week before the event starts on July 26th, we’ll do short reviews related to Hackatom. Today, we’ll take a look at the past year’s event.

[Hackatom VI 2021](https://hackatom.org/) was held in Lisbon, Berlin, and lasted for a month online. It became the biggest Hacatom in Cosmos history with a total prize pool of $1 million worth of ATOM.

In addition, the media sponsor of the event was Omnifix.
